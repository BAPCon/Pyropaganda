        "description": "Georgia nonprofit \"All for Lunch\" ended 2022 by paying off outstanding lunch debt in metro Atlanta schools, totaling over $147,000 at 302 schools over the year.",
        "content": "A Georgia woman's nonprofit organization \"All for Lunch\" took charge over the holiday season to ensure families in metro Atlanta schools would not end the year with outstanding school lunch debt. The organization, based out of Forsyth County, paid around $130,000 to eliminate lunch debt at schools in Fulton, Cobb, Gwinnett, Forsyth and Barrow counties in December alone. Founder Alessandra Ferrera-Miller told Fox 5 Atlanta the idea formed in 2018 when she started paying off school lunch debt in the surrounding area. She started with four schools and donated $500 to alleviate overspent accounts.\u00a0 At the end of the \"most impactful year\" yet, Ferrera-Miller said this is just the beginning. USDA HOPES $50M CAN MAKE SCHOOL LUNCH MORE \u2018APPETIZING,\u2019 \u2018APPEALING\u2019 According to the \"All for Lunch\" website, $147,198.06 in lunch debt was paid off at 302 Georgia schools during 2022. \"As we look ahead to 2023, we are excited to continue our work in Georgia while also expanding our reach into schools throughout the country to make sure every child has access to lunch at school, so they can focus on learning, not on being hungry,\" the website stated. Ferrera-Miller said her goal is not to solely provide a onetime payment to a school, but to ensure the help she gives lasts because the paid-off balances may not. WEST VIRGINIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HOPING TO BECOME TEACHERS CAN SEEK SCHOLARSHIP The organization's mission is to make sure every child has access to a hot meal at school, regardless of their financial situation at home. Ferrera-Miller believes not having sufficient lunch money for children to eat at school should not be a problem families face, but it is. According to \"All for Lunch,\" over 75% of schools nationwide carry school lunch debt. The Food Resource and Action Center reports \"a school lunch reduces food insecurity, improves children's dietary intake, and positively impacts their health.\" Stats on the website show 133 schools are free of school lunch debt, and over $65,000 lunches have been funded for those in need.",

        "content": "A lot of things went wrong in 2022. Inflation, lousy bond and stock markets, Russia\u2019s horrific and unprovoked attack against Ukraine, President Joe Biden\u2019s greenlighting millions \u2013 yes, millions \u2013 of migrants crossing our southern border illegally, rampant urban crime and even more indoctrination of our kids.  But it was not all gloom and doom. There were obvious victories to celebrate (Ukraine routing Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s army, Anthony Fauci\u2019s retirement) as well as losses to mourn (the $1.7 trillion omnibus spending bill, another failed GOP effort to win the Senate.) Further afield, here are my candidates for top winners and losers.  New York sports fans. The Yankees and Mets both made it to the playoffs this year, the Knicks are enjoying an OK season, and the Nets winning, despite the firing of their coach and issues with star point guard Kyrie Irving.\u00a0OK, so the Jets have fumbled recently, but both they and the Giants are in the hunt for a playoff spot.  RON DESANTIS\u2019 \u2018FREEDOM BLUEPRINT\u2019 TOUTED BY SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS AS WAY TO ELECT MORE CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATES Tom Brady, the greatest NFL quarterback of all time, whose reputation has been sacked for having \"retired\" from the game he dominated, only to return to the field a mere 40 days later. And, for possibly sticking around too long; the Tampa Bay Buccaneers may get to the playoffs but currently they have a losing season, the first of Brady\u2019s career. Reportedly, the return to the field also cost the GOAT his wife, supermodel Gisele Bundchen. Gotta know when to hang it up Tom; when you figure it out, please call Biden.\u00a0 NASA, which enjoyed an astronomical victory with the successful 25-day trip of Artemis, a 32-story tall rocket. The unmanned spacecraft circled the moon, presumably (though not officially) checking out what China has been up to on the dark side. Not only did NASA get back in the space exploration game, it also successfully bumped an asteroid off course (fans of Bruce Willis\u2019 \"Armageddon\" rejoice) and unfolded in space the final configuration of the James Webb Space Telescope that relayed out-of-this world images of the universe\u2019s earliest galaxies.  The FBI, our once-respected crack law enforcement agency, has lost the confidence of all right-thinking Americans. The FBI has been caught out for manipulating public opinion, interfering in our elections and working on behalf of the White House for partisan purposes. The release of the Twitter files makes clear that Russiagate was no one-off. The FBI pressured Twitter, and most likely other social media giants, to censor information damaging to Hunter Biden and to his dad Joe Biden, and sat on the infamous laptop of the First Son even as they pushed to discredit the information it contained. A new survey shows 63% of likely U.S. voters want Congress to investigate the FBI; count me in.\u00a0 Elon Musk, who has sacrificed tens of billions of dollars of his personal wealth to protect free speech in our country. Musk, the one-time darling of tree-hugging liberals who also embraced Tesla, is now vilified for outing bad actors in the FBI and bad conduct in Silicon Valley. Turns out- conservative voices have been muted on social media, purposefully. Shadow-banning is not a right-wing conspiracy; it happened. The nation owes Musk \u2013 as quixotic and unreliable as he sometimes is \u2013 unswerving admiration. He is down; I for one do not count him out.\u00a0 Eric Adams and the bonehead liberal policies that have destroyed blue cities like New York, over which the party-loving mayor presides. Unlike his predecessor (I\u2019ve forgotten his name), Adams is everywhere and anywhere that calls for fancy dress.\u00a0Candidate Adams talked a good game about fighting crime and welcoming businesses; some saw him running for president in 2024. That was before New Yorkers witnessed the revolving door held open for criminals and budget-busting spending with no end in sight. The city is losing the high-income taxpayers who pay the bills.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Kate Middleton, who has been the charming and dutiful wife of the UK\u2019s future king for more than a decade. The Princess of Wales is running neck-and-neck with her husband William for \"most popular royal in Great Britain\", each earning 69% approval in a recent poll. Meanwhile, her troublesome sister-in-law Meghan Markle\u2019s popularity has nosedived both in the U.S. and in Britain. A recent poll showed Americans giving Kate a net positive approval rating of 43, while the whiny Duchess of Sussex earned a negative approval figure of -32 in the U.S., meaning she was liked by 28 percent and disliked by 60 percent.  Kamala Harris, who has flunked being vice president. She has scored not one single accomplishment, turns out to be a toxic boss, is monstrously inarticulate and a whiner to boot. She recently complained of being mistreated by the press, saying: \"There are things that I\u2019ve done as vice president that fully demonstrate the strength of my leadership as vice president\u2026\" Whoa, word salad alert! Note to Kamala: the liberal media all but ignored the 12 major staff departures that took place over her first year in office; be careful what you wish for.  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who blew away his Democrat competitor in the midterm elections, has gone toe to toe with woke corporate America, tossed offensive material from grade-school curriculums and effectively managed the aftermath of devastating Hurricane Ian.

        "description": "Protesters have managed to post many videos and photos of their demonstrations to Western social media as citizens in Russia, Iran and China used more sophisticated methods.",
        "content": "Protests throughout the year demonstrated the strongest pushback against oppressive regimes in decades.\u00a0 Tensions in China, Iran and Russia boiled over at various points across 2022, driving protesters to their breaking point due to war, COVID-19 or simple denial of basic civil rights.\u00a0 The protests also reached the West with greater visibility than ever before, providing protesters a platform to spread their message and make clear to the world why they wanted change.\u00a0 The more visible elements of some protests have died down, but the people in these nations continue to voice their displeasure, marking a radical shift in their political landscapes and leading to an uncertain future as the governments look to regain loyalty and control that may have slipped from them forever.\u00a0 IRAN: \u2018BIDEN CAN\u2019T IGNORE PROTESTS, EXECUTIONS' AS REGIME EYES NUCLEAR WEAPONS AMID ATOMIC PAUSE No protest shook the world more this year than did the calls for change in Iran, which have lasted for over 100 days following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. Morality police accused Amini of failing to adhere to the country\u2019s headscarf (hijab) laws, taking her into custody and then rushing her to hospital an hour later.\u00a0 The police claimed that Amini merely fell into a coma, but her family alleged that they saw clear proof that she had suffered a beating.\u00a0 Her death kicked off what ended up the greatest pushback against the Ayatollah\u2019s regime. Videos and photos of the protests regularly reached the West, appearing on social media sites like Twitter.\u00a0 The protests also started just before the 2022 United Nations High-Level Week, during which the leaders of various nations travel to the U.N. headquarters in New York City to address the General Assembly.\u00a0 Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi was invited to speak, and his arrival created tremendous controversy, with many calling for President Biden to reject his visa application and prevent him from entering the country. Raisi did speak, and the leader positioned Iran as a victim of Western abuses.\u00a0 FEMALE IRANIAN CHESS PLAYER COMPETES AT TOURNAMENT WITHOUT WEARING HIJAB A display across the street from the U.N. headquarters showed 2,000 of some 30,000 victims that died during the 1989 Iran death commissions, in which Raisi allegedly participated and played a prominent role.\u00a0 Celebrities in Iran joined the protests, including a number of soccer players who have faced punishment for their vocal support. Officials\u00a0sentenced Amir Nasr-Azadani to death\u00a0for an alleged connection to the murder of a police colonel and two volunteer militia members, according to Iran Wire.\u00a0 The protests eventually spread to over 140 cities and towns across Iran, with reports saying up to 500 people were killed by the security forces crackdown and tens of thousands were arrested. A number of children have also died during the protests as the regime struggled to contain them.\u00a0 \"Iranian people have proved to themselves and to the world that they are willing to risk their lives in order to obtain the most basic freedoms,\" Lisa Daftari, a Middle East expert and editor-in-chief of The Foreign Desk, told Fox News Digital. \"For 43 years, this regime has repressed its people and denied them of the most basic human rights. IRAN'S TOP PROSECUTOR, KEY MILITARY FIGURES SANCTIONED BY TREASURY OVER PROTEST CRACKDOWNS \"They are hoping that the rest of the world will support their movement as well,\" Daftari continued. \"More than anything, Iranian protesters, and those who support them around the world, are hoping that in 2023 there will be more awareness, and more importantly, more public support of their movement. \"When you connect the dots, it\u2019s unfathomable, why a movement for freedom, led by women, does not have more widespread support globally. It\u2019s about human rights, freedom and world security.\"\u00a0 Following a\u00a0fire in a high-rise apartment\u00a0building in Xinjiang, citizens demanded accountability and an end to the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s \"zero-COVID\" policy, which saw local governments shut down entire cities and mandate lockdowns and widespread testing after detecting just a few cases of COVID-19.\u00a0 The fire killed 10 people, with many blaming the quarantine protocols for making it difficult for residents to escape the building. The resulting anger spilled into the streets in the greatest and most direct pushback against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\u2019s rule since the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.\u00a0 Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher at watchdog group Human Rights Watch, told Fox News Digital that the protests occurred because of the incident, but they evidenced the pent-up anger and frustration the Chinese people had toward their government. \"People were really, really frustrated that it had been three years,\" Wang said. \"Under the previous lockdowns, many people were denied access to medical care, emergency medical care, and some even died because of that \u2026 they couldn't get to the hospital because of the COVID restrictions.\u00a0 CHINA BACKS DOWN ON TESTING, QUARANTINE REQUIREMENTS AMID LOCKDOWN OUTRAGE \"Other people couldn't get food [or] medical care, because if everybody has to get food from the delivery app, of course, it's overwhelmed [by] all this \u2026 and, of course, people lost their jobs for months. They couldn't even afford to buy food anymore,\" Wang explained. \"So, I think just three years of pent-up anger and frustration, then it was triggered by the fire, and everybody felt it.\" The sheer volume of social media accounts documenting the protests overwhelmed China\u2019s censors and algorithms, breaching the famous \"Great Firewall\" of China to reach Twitter and other Western platforms. The task proved so difficult that China reportedly\u00a0spammed Twitter with posts about porn\u00a0and escorts to make it difficult for users to find protest videos when they searched for cities by name. Chinese citizens had turned to virtual private networks (VPNs) to hide their locations and allow them access to Western social media, showing the greater sophistication protesters have developed.\u00a0 Chinese media saw the start of the \"blank page protest,\" which involved the user posting a picture of a blank page and tagging the post with keywords that would otherwise evade the censors like \"good,\" \"yes\" and \"correct\" to display the sentiment that citizens are \"voiceless but also powerful,\" according to The New York Times. BEIJING BACKS DOWN: CHINESE CITIZENS \u2018EMPOWERED\u2019 AFTER COVID PROTESTS, CHINA RESEARCHER SAYS The protests achieved their goal and led to Beijing rolling back \"zero-COVID,\" but the abrupt change led to a severe spike in COVID-19 subvariants. Over 250 million people in China may have had an infection by Christmas, leading some nations to start implementing travel restrictions again as China looked to open its borders.\u00a0 Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine proved unpopular when it started with protests spreading from Moscow to Khabarovsk, a city some 4,000 miles east of the capital. One watchdog estimate puts the number of arrests at just over 19,000, with around 400 convicted in \"anti-war criminal cases.\"\u00a0 Within two weeks after the start of the war, on-air news personalities in Russia started to protest. Regulators in Russia accused Dozhd, or TV Rain, of \"inciting extremism, abusing Russian citizens, causing mass disruption of public calm and safety and encouraging protests,\" according to the BBC. Putin quickly signed a law that allowed authorities to jail journalists for up to 15 years for reporting \"fake\" news about the military and the invasion, with officials refusing to call it a \"war\" or \"invasion\" at all. Instead, they referred to the \"special operation.\"\u00a0 People also attacked military recruitment stations, setting them on fire with Molotov cocktail attacks. The attacks started again after Putin ordered a \"partial mobilization\" to help bolster the sagging numbers among his forces.\u00a0 RUSSIANS ARRESTED IN THOUSANDS WHILE PROTESTING PUTIN'S MOBILIZATION, HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP SAYS The recruitment effort again showed how unhappy people were with the war as significant numbers of men fled the country rather than risk deployment to the front lines.\u00a0 When police cracked down on the protests, the more visible elements faded, but the people grew more creative. Rachel Denber, deputy director of the Europe and Central Asia Division at Human Rights Watch, told Fox News Digital the protests have morphed as Russian authorities increased the severity of their response.\u00a0 \"I think, in order to understand the way it is that Russians are voicing their objection to the war and to mobilization, I think you have to take a much wider lens than street protests,\" Denber said.\u00a0 \"They find ways to support people who are trying to evade the draft,\" she explained. \"They sometimes engage in single-person actions out on the street, which I guess is a form of street protest and for which they, you know, face administrative or criminal charges.\"",

In 1944, Marshall became Army general \u2014 the same year Congress created the five-star rank, according to nobelprize.org. Before the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Marshall preached military readiness. Later, he was partially responsible for building, supplying and deploying more than eight million soldiers. Marshall resigned from his post in 1945 once World War II had ended. But his career didn\u2019t end there. In January 1947, Marshall joined President Harry Truman\u2019s cabinet as secretary of state. He remained in that post for two years. Marshall officially resigned from public service in September 1951 at almost 71 years old, after spending a year as secretary of defense during the Korean War. Marshall was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953 for \"proposing and supervising the plan for the economic recovery of Europe,\" as nobelprize.org noted.",

        "content": "The injuries for the Tennessee Titans continued to pile up in the second half of the season and the team suffered their sixth straight loss on Thursday night. The Cowboys beat the Titans 27-13 which marked the seventh time Tennessee has been defeated by a team with a winning record this season. But it's not all bad news for the Titans, who remaining alive in the race for the AFC South title. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The Week 18 game against the Jaguars will determine which team wins the division and clinches a home playoff game. Tennessee has compiled a 7-9 record through 16 games, but all seven of those wins have come against teams with records of .500 or below.\u00a0 TITANS PLACE RYAN TANNEHILL ON IR, EFFECTIVELY ENDING HIS SEASON The team with current best record who the Titans have prevailed against this year is the Washington Commanders who are 7-7-1. But, entering their Week 5 matchup with the Titans, the Commanders had a 1-3 record. Since Tennessee's Week 17 did not have any playoff implications, the team decided to sit several starters, including star running back Derrick Henry.\u00a0 Joshua Dobbs also got his first career NFL start, while third-round draft pick Malik Willis served as the backup. BUCS BACKUP QUARTERBACK BLAINE GABBERT HELPS RESCUE FAMILY FROM WATER AFTER HELICOPTER CRASH IN FLORIDA Throughout the first three quarters of the game, Titans were able to be competitive, partially due to a pair of interceptions by Cowboy's quarterback Dak Prescott. It remains unclear if Vrabel will decide to go with Willis as the starter next week or if he will give the rookie another chance in the pivotal game. The Titans will have a tough test against if they want to claim the division crown. The Jaguars (7-8) have won three straight heading into their Week 17 game against the Texans.\u00a0",

        "description": "Scientology leader David Miscavige, 62, is nowhere to be found as attempts are made to serve him with a child trafficking lawsuit filed by three former church members.",
        "content": "Scientology leader David Miscavige is nowhere to be found as attempts are made to serve the 62-year-old with a child trafficking lawsuit that names him as a defendant, according to public court documents and the Tampa Bay Times. The court documents show process servers attempted to serve papers to Miscavige 27 different times over the past few months in the Clearwater, Fla. area and in Los Angeles to no avail. A motion to serve Miscavige by default filed in Florida court on Dec. 13 read, \"there is more than enough evidence to demonstrate that [Miscavige] has intentionally concealed his location and erected obstacles to evade personal services of process.\" The Church of Scientology's Public Affairs Director Karin Pouw told Fox News Digital Miscavige is \"not running from the law.\" She declined to comment further on the pending lawsuit. KIRSTIE ALLEY REMEMBERED BY CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY AS 'BELOVED MEMBER' AND 'CHAMPION FOR DRUG REHABILITATION' Former Scientology church members, husband and wife, Gawain and Laura Baxter and Valeska Paris filed the lawsuit after claiming they were forced into labor on Scientology boats as children after signing a one billion-year contract in exchange for little or no money. Paris reportedly left the church in 2009 and Gawain and Laura Baxter left in 2012.  In addition to the trafficking allegations, Paris alleges she was the victim of repeated sexual assaults in her youth and that when her mother left Scientology, the then-17-year-old was locked in an engine room for 48 hours as punishment. Gawain Baxter said his parents put him in a Sea Org nursery when he was two months old, according to the lawsuit. When he turned six, he was also forced to sign the one billion-year contract and sent to live in a Cadet Org dormitory with around 100 other children. Children over six years old are considered to be, and are frequently told that they are, adults and that they should act and expect to be treated as adults. The lawsuit noted in background that the children must be referred to as \"cadets\" and not kids. CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY GOT TOM CRUISE A DIVORCE, HELPED HIM MARRY NICOLE KIDMAN, BOOK ALLEGES Miscavige's last known address is the church's international building in L.A., but similar to other members of Scientology's extremist wing, the Sea Org, he does not have a publicly recorded address. When lawyers showed up to Scientology properties in search of the leader, security guards denied entry to the properties and reportedly said they were not aware of his location.\u00a0 The plaintiffs in the lawsuit have also hired a private investigator to help reach Miscavige, according to\u00a0 Court filings related to the recent lawsuit list his home as a Scientology property in a gated community known as the Hacienda Gardens in Clearwater. The 120-unit apartment complex hosts Scientology staff and was purchased by the organization in 2001, the Tampa Bay Times reported. During the motion filed earlier in December, one of the plaintiff's attorneys, Neil Glazer, said, \"Miscavige cannot be permitted to continue his gamesmanship.\" He is due in court on Jan. 20, 2023, but that meeting is pending unless he is served with the papers. Court documents related to the suit stated lawyers have tried to locate him through two traffic tickets he received in the 1990s, but both of those citations list the Scientology Los Angeles center as his home. Miscavige's lawyers told the newspaper he is merely the target of a legal strategy due to his status within Scientology. They added that he does not live in Florida, which is why they can't serve him there. US Magistrate Judge Julie Sneed served a summons to Miscavige on behalf of the plaintiffs. Ten copies of the summons were sent to various Scientology properties in Florida and California in efforts to reach Miscavige.\u00a0 All were sent back as undelivered since nobody would sign for them, court documents showed. Miscavige is one of five defendants named in the lawsuit. The remaining four are operating entities of the Church of Scientology.",

        "title": "Protests against repressive regimes demonstrated greatest pushback in decades as citizens demand freedom",
        "description": "Protesters have managed to post many videos and photos of their demonstrations to Western social media as citizens in Russia, Iran and China used more sophisticated methods.",
        "content": "Protests throughout the year demonstrated the strongest pushback against oppressive regimes in decades.\u00a0 Tensions in China, Iran and Russia boiled over at various points across 2022, driving protesters to their breaking point due to war, COVID-19 or simple denial of basic civil rights.\u00a0 The protests also reached the West with greater visibility than ever before, providing protesters a platform to spread their message and make clear to the world why they wanted change.\u00a0 The more visible elements of some protests have died down, but the people in these nations continue to voice their displeasure, marking a radical shift in their political landscapes and leading to an uncertain future as the governments look to regain loyalty and control that may have slipped from them forever.\u00a0 IRAN: \u2018BIDEN CAN\u2019T IGNORE PROTESTS, EXECUTIONS' AS REGIME EYES NUCLEAR WEAPONS AMID ATOMIC PAUSE No protest shook the world more this year than did the calls for change in Iran, which have lasted for over 100 days following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini. Morality police accused Amini of failing to adhere to the country\u2019s headscarf (hijab) laws, taking her into custody and then rushing her to hospital an hour later.\u00a0 The police claimed that Amini merely fell into a coma, but her family alleged that they saw clear proof that she had suffered a beating.\u00a0 Her death kicked off what ended up the greatest pushback against the Ayatollah\u2019s regime. Videos and photos of the protests regularly reached the West, appearing on social media sites like Twitter.\u00a0 The protests also started just before the 2022 United Nations High-Level Week, during which the leaders of various nations travel to the U.N. headquarters in New York City to address the General Assembly.\u00a0 Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi was invited to speak, and his arrival created tremendous controversy, with many calling for President Biden to reject his visa application and prevent him from entering the country. Raisi did speak, and the leader positioned Iran as a victim of Western abuses.\u00a0 FEMALE IRANIAN CHESS PLAYER COMPETES AT TOURNAMENT WITHOUT WEARING HIJAB A display across the street from the U.N. headquarters showed 2,000 of some 30,000 victims that died during the 1989 Iran death commissions, in which Raisi allegedly participated and played a prominent role.\u00a0 Celebrities in Iran joined the protests, including a number of soccer players who have faced punishment for their vocal support. Officials\u00a0sentenced Amir Nasr-Azadani to death\u00a0for an alleged connection to the murder of a police colonel and two volunteer militia members, according to Iran Wire.\u00a0 The protests eventually spread to over 140 cities and towns across Iran, with reports saying up to 500 people were killed by the security forces crackdown and tens of thousands were arrested. A number of children have also died during the protests as the regime struggled to contain them.\u00a0 \"Iranian people have proved to themselves and to the world that they are willing to risk their lives in order to obtain the most basic freedoms,\" Lisa Daftari, a Middle East expert and editor-in-chief of The Foreign Desk, told Fox News Digital. \"For 43 years, this regime has repressed its people and denied them of the most basic human rights. IRAN'S TOP PROSECUTOR, KEY MILITARY FIGURES SANCTIONED BY TREASURY OVER PROTEST CRACKDOWNS \"They are hoping that the rest of the world will support their movement as well,\" Daftari continued. \"More than anything, Iranian protesters, and those who support them around the world, are hoping that in 2023 there will be more awareness, and more importantly, more public support of their movement. \"When you connect the dots, it\u2019s unfathomable, why a movement for freedom, led by women, does not have more widespread support globally. It\u2019s about human rights, freedom and world security.\"\u00a0 Following a\u00a0fire in a high-rise apartment\u00a0building in Xinjiang, citizens demanded accountability and an end to the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s \"zero-COVID\" policy, which saw local governments shut down entire cities and mandate lockdowns and widespread testing after detecting just a few cases of COVID-19.\u00a0 The fire killed 10 people, with many blaming the quarantine protocols for making it difficult for residents to escape the building. The resulting anger spilled into the streets in the greatest and most direct pushback against the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\u2019s rule since the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.\u00a0 Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher at watchdog group Human Rights Watch, told Fox News Digital that the protests occurred because of the incident, but they evidenced the pent-up anger and frustration the Chinese people had toward their government. \"People were really, really frustrated that it had been three years,\" Wang said. \"Under the previous lockdowns, many people were denied access to medical care, emergency medical care, and some even died because of that \u2026 they couldn't get to the hospital because of the COVID restrictions.\u00a0 CHINA BACKS DOWN ON TESTING, QUARANTINE REQUIREMENTS AMID LOCKDOWN OUTRAGE \"Other people couldn't get food [or] medical care, because if everybody has to get food from the delivery app, of course, it's overwhelmed [by] all this \u2026 and, of course, people lost their jobs for months. They couldn't even afford to buy food anymore,\" Wang explained. \"So, I think just three years of pent-up anger and frustration, then it was triggered by the fire, and everybody felt it.\" The sheer volume of social media accounts documenting the protests overwhelmed China\u2019s censors and algorithms, breaching the famous \"Great Firewall\" of China to reach Twitter and other Western platforms. The task proved so difficult that China reportedly\u00a0spammed Twitter with posts about porn\u00a0and escorts to make it difficult for users to find protest videos when they searched for cities by name. Chinese citizens had turned to virtual private networks (VPNs) to hide their locations and allow them access to Western social media, showing the greater sophistication protesters have developed.\u00a0 Chinese media saw the start of the \"blank page protest,\" which involved the user posting a picture of a blank page and tagging the post with keywords that would otherwise evade the censors like \"good,\" \"yes\" and \"correct\" to display the sentiment that citizens are \"voiceless but also powerful,\" according to The New York Times. BEIJING BACKS DOWN: CHINESE CITIZENS \u2018EMPOWERED\u2019 AFTER COVID PROTESTS, CHINA RESEARCHER SAYS The protests achieved their goal and led to Beijing rolling back \"zero-COVID,\" but the abrupt change led to a severe spike in COVID-19 subvariants. Over 250 million people in China may have had an infection by Christmas, leading some nations to start implementing travel restrictions again as China looked to open its borders.\u00a0 Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine proved unpopular when it started with protests spreading from Moscow to Khabarovsk, a city some 4,000 miles east of the capital. One watchdog estimate puts the number of arrests at just over 19,000, with around 400 convicted in \"anti-war criminal cases.\"\u00a0 Within two weeks after the start of the war, on-air news personalities in Russia started to protest. Regulators in Russia accused Dozhd, or TV Rain, of \"inciting extremism, abusing Russian citizens, causing mass disruption of public calm and safety and encouraging protests,\" according to the BBC. Putin quickly signed a law that allowed authorities to jail journalists for up to 15 years for reporting \"fake\" news about the military and the invasion, with officials refusing to call it a \"war\" or \"invasion\" at all. Instead, they referred to the \"special operation.\"\u00a0 People also attacked military recruitment stations, setting them on fire with Molotov cocktail attacks. The attacks started again after Putin ordered a \"partial mobilization\" to help bolster the sagging numbers among his forces.\u00a0 RUSSIANS ARRESTED IN THOUSANDS WHILE PROTESTING PUTIN'S MOBILIZATION, HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP SAYS The recruitment effort again showed how unhappy people were with the war as significant numbers of men fled the country rather than risk deployment to the front lines.\u00a0 When police cracked down on the protests, the more visible elements faded, but the people grew more creative. Rachel Denber, deputy director of the Europe and Central Asia Division at Human Rights Watch, told Fox News Digital the protests have morphed as Russian authorities increased the severity of their response.\u00a0 \"I think, in order to understand the way it is that Russians are voicing their objection to the war and to mobilization, I think you have to take a much wider lens than street protests,\" Denber said.\u00a0 \"They find ways to support people who are trying to evade the draft,\" she explained. \"They sometimes engage in single-person actions out on the street, which I guess is a form of street protest and for which they, you know, face administrative or criminal charges.\"",

        "content": "The Indian maker of a cough syrup that was linked to the death of 19 children in Uzbekistan said on Friday that it had halted production of all medicines after an inspection by the drug regulator. Indian media reported that the inspectors had found deviation from rules on manufacturing at one of Marion Biotech's units. Neither Marion Biotech or India's health ministry immediately responded to a Reuters request for comment on the media reports or the inspections findings. Uzbekistan's health ministry said at least 18 children died in Samarkand city after consuming Marion Biotech's Dok-1 Max syrup. Uzbek media on Thursday reported a 19th victim, with the death of a one-year-old child. Uzbekistan's ministry had said the syrup contained a toxic substance, ethylene glycol, and was administered in doses higher than the standard dose for children, either by their parents, who mistook it for an anti-cold remedy, or on the advice of pharmacists. WARNING FROM LASIK EYE-SURGERY PATIENTS TO FDA: MORE NOTICE OF \u2018SIDE EFFECTS\u2019 IS NEEDED India's drug regulator and regional authorities had inspected Marion Biotech's facility in Noida, close to Delhi, India's health ministry said on Thursday, as Uzbekistan took legal action against a local representative of the company. News broadcaster NDTV reported on Friday that Indian authorities have ordered a complete halt of production of all drugs at the company's Noida facility after finding deviation from rules on manufacturing. WOMAN WHO LOST HER SOULMATE TO FENTANYL DISCUSSES GRIEF AROUND HOLIDAYS, HONORING LOST LOVED ONES Hasan Harris, Marion Biotech's legal head, told Reuters partner ANI, \"We await the reports, the factory was inspected. We've halted production of all medicines.\" Uzbekistan was withdrawing the Dok-1 Max tablets and syrups from all pharmacies while local media reported that the country has also suspended sales of another Marion Biotech anti-cold syrup named Ambronol. India is known as the 'pharmacy of the world', and has doubled its pharmaceutical exports over the last decade, touching $24.5 billion in the last fiscal year. The Uzbekistan case follows deaths of at least 70 children in Gambia that had been linked to cough and cold syrups manufactured by New Delhi-based Maiden Pharmaceuticals Ltd. Both the Indian government and the company, however, have denied wrongdoing.",

        "content": "China's meat trade on Friday cheered the imminent end of testing and disinfecting chilled and frozen foods for COVID-19, more than two years after Beijing started the controversial practice, adding substantial costs to the trade. The State Administration for Market Regulation will stop testing chilled and frozen foods for COVID-19 from Jan. 8, according to a notice seen by Reuters and confirmed by the agency. It will also no longer require all imported chilled and frozen foods to enter centralized warehouses for disinfection and testing before they reach the domestic market. ITALY TO TEST AIRLINE PASSENGERS FROM CHINA AFTER HALF OF TRAVELERS TO MILAN SAID TO HAVE COVID-19 The dropping of measures follows a similar announcement from the customs authority on Wednesday that it will stop testing cold-chain food arriving at the country's ports. \"This policy means we will have much lower cost and risk on both product storage and transportation,\" said a Beijing-based meat importer that buys beef and pork from the United States and other countries. Having imposed the world's strictest COVID regime of lockdowns and relentless testing for three years, China reversed course this month towards living with the virus, though new infections have soared. China started testing chilled and frozen food imports for COVID in 2020 after an outbreak of the disease in a wholesale market led authorities to believe the virus had spread from imported produce. COVID IN BEIJING 'PEAKS' AS HOSPITALS, FUNERAL HOMES FILL UP The practice was controversial with trade partners and significantly slowed the shipment of food to China, the world's top buyer of meat and many other perishable goods. It also raised costs for both importers and exporters. \"The cancellation of testing and disinfection requirements will definitely benefit the meat trade in terms of reducing extra cost and speeding up movement of goods,\" said Huang Juhui, founder of Beijing Means Consulting Co. COVID testing and disinfection, moving the goods from the port to central storage, demurrage, electricity, and centralized storage costs can add up to as much as 30,000 yuan ($4,321) per container, and take up to 30 days, said Huang. \"The reported ending of COVID testing and disinfection of imported meat at ports and at in-market distribution points will be an encouraging step toward the resumption of normalized trade,\" said Joel Haggard, Senior Vice President of the Asia Pacific Region at the U.S. Meat Export Federation.",

South Korea would also restrict issuing short-term visas for Chinese nationals until the end of next month and temporarily halt increasing flights from China while using Incheon International Airport as the only gateway for any flights from the neighbouring country, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said. Effective Jan. 5, travellers from China would be required to submit a negative result from a PCR test no more than 48 hours or a rapid antigen test taken within 24 hours before departure, and undergo another PCR test upon arrival starting Jan. 2, officials said. COUNTRIES IMPLEMENT COVID TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS FOR CHINESE TRAVELERS AMID TRANSPARENCY CONCERNS South Korean authorities said the new restrictions were needed after Beijing stopped publishing daily data on cases, raising concerns over a new wave of infections and mutations. While most of the new rules are set to be in place until the end of February, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said they could be extended. EU REJECTS ITALY'S 'UNJUSTIFIED' PUSH TO TEST CHINESE ARRIVALS FOR COVID \"We need to urgently prepare for any domestic ripple effects following China's easing of quarantine rules,\" Han said. \"We will prepare to take stronger measures in case the situation gets worse, if we see a rapid increase of infections from new arrivals or appearance of new variants.\" South Korea also aims to limit the sale of cold medicines to deter people from hoarding or buying to sell overseas, the health ministry said on Friday, adding that details of the plan would be discussed next week. Customs officers will step up inspections of cold medicines being taken out of the country. South Korean media have reported instances of Chinese visitors buying large quantities from pharmacies. \"We will deal strongly with... the recently reported hoarding of cold medicine and concerns of an adverse effect on cold medicine supply,\" the ministry said in a statement. China this month began dismantling the world's strictest COVID regime of lockdowns and extensive testing in an abrupt change of policy, prompting countries to impose or consider imposing curbs on travellers from China amid a surge in cases there.",

        "content": "A Georgia woman's nonprofit organization \"All for Lunch\" took charge over the holiday season to ensure families in metro Atlanta schools would not end the year with outstanding school lunch debt. The organization, based out of Forsyth County, paid around $130,000 to eliminate lunch debt at schools in Fulton, Cobb, Gwinnett, Forsyth and Barrow counties in December alone. Founder Alessandra Ferrera-Miller told Fox 5 Atlanta the idea formed in 2018 when she started paying off school lunch debt in the surrounding area. She started with four schools and donated $500 to alleviate overspent accounts.\u00a0 At the end of the \"most impactful year\" yet, Ferrera-Miller said this is just the beginning.

Ferrera-Miller said her goal is not to solely provide a onetime payment to a school, but to ensure the help she gives lasts because the paid-off balances may not. WEST VIRGINIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HOPING TO BECOME TEACHERS CAN SEEK SCHOLARSHIP The organization's mission is to make sure every child has access to a hot meal at school, regardless of their financial situation at home. Ferrera-Miller believes not having sufficient lunch money for children to eat at school should not be a problem families face, but it is. According to \"All for Lunch,\" over 75% of schools nationwide carry school lunch debt. The Food Resource and Action Center reports \"a school lunch reduces food insecurity, improves children's dietary intake, and positively impacts their health.\" Stats on the website show 133 schools are free of school lunch debt, and over $65,000 lunches have been funded for those in need.",

Other states that have strict abortion laws include Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

Bryan Christopher Kohberger was arrested thousands of miles from Idaho, in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, early Friday morning. But police have since said he was a graduate student at Washington State University, and he had been living in Pullman.\u00a0 CRIMINOLOGIST GRAD STUDENT HIT WITH FOUR COUNTS OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER Justin Williams, a 34-year-old WSU employee who lives in an adjacent building, told Fox News Digital he had occasionally seen Kohberger in the neighborhood, typically while Kohberger was retrieving his mail.\u00a0 WATCH: LATAH COUNTY PROSECUTOR BILL THOMPSON, LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTER SUSPECT'S APARTMENT Neighbors at the Steptoe Village, the WSU housing complex mostly inhabited by graduate or PhD students, among others, described the area as \"quiet\" and nestled in the city of Pullman, which is typically \"so safe.\"\u00a0 UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO MURDERS TIMELINE: WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE SLAUGHTER OF FOUR STUDENTS \"I\u2019d see him go check his mail, that was it. Other than that, I\u2019ve only seen him like twice the whole time, and I\u2019ve lived here since July 2021,\" said Justin Williams, who lived in an adjacent building.\u00a0 He said he saw \"nothing unusual\" from his now-accused neighbor. Williams said he learned that Kohberger had been arrested just this morning, from social media, and spotted some of the law enforcement vehicles in the parking lot outside his home.\u00a0 Upon hearing the news, he said he wondered, \"How long has he f------ been here? Has he been here the whole time that I have?\"\u00a0 WSU employee Randy Smith, 58, said he arrived at the housing complex on Northeast Valley Road around 7:30 a.m. to see multiple unmarked vehicles, later determined to be law enforcement, already in front of Kohberger\u2019s building.\u00a0 IDAHO MURDER SUSPECT: WHO IS BRYAN CHRISTOPHER KOHBERGER \"There was that black pickup and the silver pickup,\" he said, pointing to vehicles parked in the lot, \"and a couple of cops, and they were taking pictures and stuff, but didn't have any tape up.\"\u00a0 They established a perimeter shortly thereafter with crime scene tape, and law enforcement personnel from several agencies, including Washington State University Police and Moscow Police Department, executed a search warrant at Kohberger\u2019s second-story apartment building.\u00a0 Images from the scene show law enforcement personnel, including Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson, ascending the stairs to the home and donning protective gear before entering. They remained for hours.\u00a0 Meanwhile, neighbors wondered what was happening in the complex, where children\u2019s bikes could be seen parked near front doors. Andrew Chua, a 28-year-old graduate student who also works at the university, said he heard commotion outside of his apartment building \u2013 just steps from Kohberger\u2019s \u2013 early Friday morning, but said he had not noticed anything \"at all\" unusual over the past several weeks.\u00a0 He did not recognize Kohberger\u2019s picture. IDAHO STUDENTS' FAMILIES REACT TO PENNSYLVANIA ARREST OF MURDER SUSPECT BRYAN KOHBERGER \"If I didn\u2019t know about this issue, it\u2019s a very quiet, very nice place to live,\" Chua went on. \"Now, I\u2019m like, \u2018Maybe I should stay home.\u2019\" A spokesperson for Washington State University said Friday \"Kohberger had completed his first semester as a PhD student in WSU\u2019s criminal justice program earlier this month.\" \"This morning, the Washington State University Police Department assisted Idaho law enforcement officials in the execution of search warrants at Mr. Kohberger\u2019s apartment and office, which are both located on the WSU campus,\" the spokesperson said. \"WSU Police are working closely with local, state, and federal law enforcement officials as they continue their investigation.\" Kohberger has been charged with felony burglary and four counts of first-degree murder for the violent stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students: Ethan Chapin, 20, Kaylee Goncalves, 21, Xana Kernodle, 20 and Madison Mogen, 21. IDAHO MURDERS: SLAIN STUDENT'S DAD SAYS ALLEGED KILLER'S ARREST IS 'FIRST SENSE OF JOY' IN WEEKS During an afternoon press conference, Prosecutor Thompson said information would be limited until Kohberger, 28, was extradited to Idaho from Pennsylvania. An extradition hearing is scheduled for Tuesday.\u00a0 Kohberger's apartment is a 21-minute drive and roughly 11 miles from the crime scene. His arrest came nearly seven weeks after the students were slain in the early morning hours of Nov. 13. Shawn Domgaard, a 36-year-old PhD student at WSU, said the news of an arrest just steps from his home is \"hard to process.\"\u00a0 WATCH: IDAHO MURDER SUSPECT'S NEIGHBOR REACTS TO GRAD STUDENT'S ARREST \"It\u2019s just so, like I said, a high contrast to what we\u2019re used to,\" said the father of three young kids, who is originally from Utah. \"It feels like it\u2019s happening far away even though it\u2019s literally in my backyard.\"\u00a0 He added: \"It\u2019s scary, but also good to have some closure \u2026 A lot of mixed emotions, I guess.\"",

        "description": "The city of Memphis admitted police didn't collect fingerprints at the scene of a rape allegedly committed by Eliza Fletcher's accused killer a year earlier.",
        "content": "The City of Memphis admitted this week the police department didn\u2019t take fingerprints at the scene of an alleged rape by Eliza Fletcher\u2019s suspected killer a year before her death, according to a report.\u00a0 Items included the victim's purse and cellphone, which she had told investigators her alleged rapist had touched.\u00a0 The department responded on Monday in a court document to a lawsuit filed by Alicia Franklin, who said she was raped by Cleotha Abston (aka Henderson) in September 2021, but the Memphis Police Department didn\u2019t properly investigate her attack, allowing him to stay out of jail.\u00a0 Abston was charged earlier this year with abducting and murdering Fletcher in Memphis while she was out on an early morning jog in September.\u00a0 ELIZA FLETCHER MURDER SUSPECT ALLEGEDLY CONNECTED TO 2021 RAPE; POLICE DIDN'T REQUEST \u2018EXPEDITED\u2019 DNA REVIEW Later that same month, he was charged with aggravated kidnapping and rape in Franklin's case.\u00a0 Franklin says she met Abston, who she only knew by his first name, on a dating app and the two agreed to meet up at an apartment building where he said he worked maintenance before heading out for dinner before her alleged rape, according to WMC-TV.\u00a0 Her rape kit sat on a shelf of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) for a year and was only sent to a national database after Fletcher\u2019s body was found, according to WMC. Franklin said she took investigators to the scene of the alleged attack immediately and gave them information such as his phone number, the name he gave her and the type of car he drove but said they didn\u2019t take any evidence from the scene.\u00a0 ELIZA FLETCHER MURDER SUSPECT SLAPPED WITH 'UNRELATED' KIDNAPPING AND RAPE CHARGES The city, which has asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed, admitted it didn\u2019t collect fingerprints at the scene but said Franklin was only able to give \"CJ\" as the suspect\u2019s name.\u00a0 The city has also requested\u00a0\"immaterial, impertinent and scandalous allegations\" be removed from the lawsuit if it isn\u2019t dismissed. A public information officer with the Memphis Police Department told Fox News Digital in September that probable cause to make \"any\" arrest didn't exist until the DNA hit was received.\u00a0 A spokesperson for TBI told Fox News that the\u00a0Memphis Police Department\u00a0didn't request an expedited analysis of the sexual assault kit from the September 2021 alleged rape, and \"no suspect information or DNA standard was included in the submission.\" Because the analysis wasn't expedited and was placed into the \"queue of unknown assailant kits,\" a forensic scientist with the TBI began its review of the sexual assault kit on June 24, and finished an \"initial report\" on Aug. 29. Afterward, the unknown male DNA profile was entered into the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, which resulted in a positive match of Abston on Sept. 5. The TBI then reported its findings to the Memphis Police Department. The TBI spokesperson told Fox News that when it receives an expedited request for analysis on a sexual assault kit, it usually takes five business days to process \"depending on the amount of evidence submitted.\" The Memphis Police Department didn't immediately to Fox News Digital's request for comment on Friday.

        "description": "Scientology leader David Miscavige, 62, is nowhere to be found as attempts are made to serve him with a child trafficking lawsuit filed by three former church members.",
        "content": "Scientology leader David Miscavige is nowhere to be found as attempts are made to serve the 62-year-old with a child trafficking lawsuit that names him as a defendant, according to public court documents and the Tampa Bay Times. The court documents show process servers attempted to serve papers to Miscavige 27 different times over the past few months in the Clearwater, Fla. area and in Los Angeles to no avail. A motion to serve Miscavige by default filed in Florida court on Dec. 13 read, \"there is more than enough evidence to demonstrate that [Miscavige] has intentionally concealed his location and erected obstacles to evade personal services of process.\" The Church of Scientology's Public Affairs Director Karin Pouw told Fox News Digital Miscavige is \"not running from the law.\" She declined to comment further on the pending lawsuit. KIRSTIE ALLEY REMEMBERED BY CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY AS 'BELOVED MEMBER' AND 'CHAMPION FOR DRUG REHABILITATION' Former Scientology church members, husband and wife, Gawain and Laura Baxter and Valeska Paris filed the lawsuit after claiming they were forced into labor on Scientology boats as children after signing a one billion-year contract in exchange for little or no money. Paris reportedly left the church in 2009 and Gawain and Laura Baxter left in 2012.  In addition to the trafficking allegations, Paris alleges she was the victim of repeated sexual assaults in her youth and that when her mother left Scientology, the then-17-year-old was locked in an engine room for 48 hours as punishment. Gawain Baxter said his parents put him in a Sea Org nursery when he was two months old, according to the lawsuit. When he turned six, he was also forced to sign the one billion-year contract and sent to live in a Cadet Org dormitory with around 100 other children. Children over six years old are considered to be, and are frequently told that they are, adults and that they should act and expect to be treated as adults. The lawsuit noted in background that the children must be referred to as \"cadets\" and not kids. CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY GOT TOM CRUISE A DIVORCE, HELPED HIM MARRY NICOLE KIDMAN, BOOK ALLEGES Miscavige's last known address is the church's international building in L.A., but similar to other members of Scientology's extremist wing, the Sea Org, he does not have a publicly recorded address. When lawyers showed up to Scientology properties in search of the leader, security guards denied entry to the properties and reportedly said they were not aware of his location.\u00a0 The plaintiffs in the lawsuit have also hired a private investigator to help reach Miscavige, according to\u00a0 Court filings related to the recent lawsuit list his home as a Scientology property in a gated community known as the Hacienda Gardens in Clearwater. The 120-unit apartment complex hosts Scientology staff and was purchased by the organization in 2001, the Tampa Bay Times reported. During the motion filed earlier in December, one of the plaintiff's attorneys, Neil Glazer, said, \"Miscavige cannot be permitted to continue his gamesmanship.\" He is due in court on Jan. 20, 2023, but that meeting is pending unless he is served with the papers. Court documents related to the suit stated lawyers have tried to locate him through two traffic tickets he received in the 1990s, but both of those citations list the Scientology Los Angeles center as his home. Miscavige's lawyers told the newspaper he is merely the target of a legal strategy due to his status within Scientology. They added that he does not live in Florida, which is why they can't serve him there. US Magistrate Judge Julie Sneed served a summons to Miscavige on behalf of the plaintiffs. Ten copies of the summons were sent to various Scientology properties in Florida and California in efforts to reach Miscavige.\u00a0 All were sent back as undelivered since nobody would sign for them, court documents showed. Miscavige is one of five defendants named in the lawsuit. The remaining four are operating entities of the Church of Scientology.",

        "description": "This is what is known so far about the grisly murders of four University of Idaho students, who were found stabbed to death in an off-campus home Nov. 13, according to police.",
        "content": "MOSCOW, Idaho \u2014 Nearly seven weeks after four University of Idaho students were brutally murdered, police arrested a suspect more than 2,500 miles away in eastern Pennsylvania. Bryan Christopher Kohberger, 28, a PhD student at Washington State University in Pullman, Washington, was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and felony burglary for the Nov. 13 stabbing deaths of Ethan Chapin, 20; Madison Mogen, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Kaylee Goncalves, 21. Mogen, Kernodle and Goncalves lived with two other students in a six-bedroom home off campus at 1122 King Road near fraternity row. Chapin, who was dating Kernodle, was staying the night. This is what is known about what happened before and after the killings and the progress of the investigation. UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO HOMICIDES: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE 4 VICTIMS ALLEGEDLY KILLED NEAR CAMPUS At 8:57 p.m., Goncalves posted a series of cheerful\u00a0pictures on Instagram with the caption, \"One lucky girl to be surrounded by these pple everyday.\" In one of the photos, Mogen sits on Goncalves\u2019 shoulders, as Chapin and Kernodle stand next to them smiling. That night, Mogen and Goncalves hung out at Corner Club, a downtown bar at 202 N. Main St., while Chapin and Kernodle went to a party together at the Sigma Chi house at 735 Nez Perce Drive on campus,\u00a0according to police. Mogen and Goncalves were captured on a Twitch livestream at 1:41 a.m. at the Grub truck in downtown Moscow, where they ordered carbonara and chatted with people nearby. A man wearing a hoodie standing near them became the subject of intense online speculation, but police later said he is not a suspect. A sorority driving service got them home at about 1:56 a.m., according to police and family. Chapin and Kernodle returned home from Sigma Chi at about 1:45 a.m. The two female roommates who survived the attack returned home from their night out at 1 a.m. and didn\u2019t wake up until late the next morning. Alivea Goncalves told Inside Edition that her sister, Kaylee, called her ex-boyfriend, Jack DuCoeur, seven times between 2:26 a.m. and 2:44 a.m. Police have cleared him as a suspect. The four victims were stabbed to death with a fixed-blade knife between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. on the second and third floors of the home, according to police. The murder weapon has not been recovered. The surviving roommates summoned friends to the house because they believed one of the second-floor victims had passed out. UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO MURDERS: TWO ROOMMATES WERE AT HOME WHEN FOUR STUDENTS WERE KILLED A call to 911 was placed from one of the surviving roommates' phones at 11:58 a.m. from inside the residence, reporting an unconscious person. Police said multiple people spoke to the dispatcher. At 2 p.m. Sunday, the university notified students of the homicides and told them to \"shelter in place.\" However, the order was lifted an hour later. Moscow Mayor Art Bettge told a news outlet that the slayings were a \"crime of passion\" before backtracking in a statement to Fox News Digital, saying that this was one of several potential motives being probed by investigators. Police said they did\u00a0not believe there was an ongoing risk to the community based on information gathered during the preliminary investigation. In another statement, police told the public this was an \"isolated, targeted attack, and there is no imminent threat to the community at large.\" SLAIN UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO VICTIM'S PARENTS FRUSTRATED BY \u2018LACK OF INFORMATION\u2019 FROM POLICE, SCHOOL Moscow residents, students and victims' families complained about the limited and contradictory information being released by public officials. At a press conference, Moscow Police Chief James Fry revealed to reporters for the first time that there were two female roommates at the home during the horrific attack, and they were unharmed. UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO MURDERS: THREAT STILL POSSIBLE WITHOUT ANY SUSPECTS IN CUSTODY, POLICE Fry did not identify the 911 caller or offer an explanation for the call coming in more than eight hours after the slayings. There were no signs of forced entry, he added. He walked back earlier assertions that the crime posed no ongoing danger to the community. \"We do not have a suspect at this time and that individual is still out there,\" Fry said. \"We cannot say there is no threat to the community, and as we have stated, please stay vigilant.\" IF IDAHO MURDER VICTIMS \u2018WERE GOING TO GO, THEY WERE GOING TO GO TOGETHER,\u2019 FRIEND SAYS He added that the FBI and the Idaho State Police are assisting in the investigation. The students' cause and manner of death were officially ruled homicide by stabbings in a press release issued by Latah County Coroner Cathy Mabbutt. She said the victims were likely ambushed in their sleep with a large knife and each had multiple stab wounds. IDAHO MURDERS: CORONER WEIGHS IN ON TOXICOLOGY REPORTS, DESCRIBES HER ROLE IN CASE Some of the victims had defensive wounds, suggesting they awoke during the attack. There were no signs of sexual assault. Police released an aerial map plotting the final movements of the four victims from the evening of Nov. 12 to the time of their murders. Police also asked the public to submit tips and surveillance footage. An Australian shepherd found skinned and filleted three weeks before the killings isn't related to the homicides, police said. Detectives also revealed for the first time that Goncalves\u2019 dog, Murphy, was inside the home when the students were killed. Police said in a press release that they \"pursued hundreds of pieces of information related to this topic and have not been able to identify or verify the identity of a stalker.\" Detectives later said they looked into an incident in which a man had followed Goncalves around in a store in mid-October but called it an \"isolated incident.\" A 1999 double stabbing in nearby Pullman, Washington, and a 2021 double stabbing in Salem, Oregon, do not appear to be connected to the King Road murders, police said. Idaho Gov. Brad Little also announced that $1 million in state emergency funds would go toward the ongoing investigation. Five vehicles were towed from the King Road home to a city lot to be stored. They were\u00a0previously searched\u00a0and are \"still part of the\u00a0crime scene,\" police said.\u00a0 Hundreds gathered for a vigil at the University of Idaho, and the families of three of the four victims addressed the community in heart-wrenching statements. Steve Goncalves, Kaylee's father, revealed for the first time that she and Mogen were\u00a0sleeping in the same bed\u00a0when they were stabbed to death. Meanwhile, the lack of a coherent message from public officials sowed further confusion. Latah County prosecutor Bill Thompson said one of the victims was \"undoubtedly targeted\" in an interview. IDAHO POLICE APPEAR TO REVERSE COURSE, DO NOT KNOW IF \u2018RESIDENCE OR ANY OCCUPANTS WERE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED\u2019 Hours later, the Moscow Police Department called Thompson\u2019s comment a miscommunication and said they had not officially deemed the murders a \"targeted\" crime, appearing to walk back their earlier assertions. \u00a0The next day, police clarified that they continue to believe the attack was \"targeted.\" Police also released a list of people they do not believe are involved in the crime: the two surviving roommates; the man in the Grub truck surveillance footage; the driver who took Mogen and Goncalves home; Goncalves\u2019 ex-boyfriend; any individual at the King Road home when the 911 call was made; and the sixth student on the lease who had moved out months earlier. Steve Goncalves told Fox News Digital that the family was frustrated over the police\u2019s lack of transparency and the progress of the investigation. \"There seems to be confusion everywhere you look,\" he said of the probe. \"It's just absurd the kind of stuff that\u2019s going on right now.\" Goncalves expressed dismay over how quickly police had cleared many people as suspects and dismissed potential connection to other crimes. \"They\u2019ve messed up a million times,\" he said of investigators. Police asked the public for help tracking down a white 2011 to 2013 Hyundai Elantra spotted near the crime scene around the time of the murders.\u00a0 IDAHO POLICE HIT WITH DELUGE OF TIPS ABOUT HYUNDAI ELANTRA, NOW FORWARDING CALLS TO FBI CALL CENTER \"Investigators believe the occupant(s) of this vehicle may have critical information to share regarding this case,\" police said in a statement. In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Steve Goncalves said the victims had \"big open gouges\" and called police \"cowards\" for not sharing more with the public. Goncalves said his daughter's injuries \"definitely did not match\" Mogen's wounds. \"They may have individually died from the exact same thing, being stabbed, but there are more details,\" he added. \"They're not even close to matching.\" FATHER OF SLAIN VICTIM SAYS SHE HAD \u2018BIG OPEN WOUNDS,\u2019 CALLS POLICE \u2018COWARDS\u2019 On Dec. 12, the Goncalves family, along with their newly hired attorney, Shanon Gray, met with police and other officials in Moscow to share their concerns over missteps in the investigation. Detectives collected eight hours of surveillance video from a gas station in Moscow where a clerk saw a white sedan pass by at 3:45 a.m. on the morning of the murders. The clerk told Fox News Digital that she had been reviewing the tapes a little bit at a time over the past few days, looking for clues in her downtime. Police haven't commented on whether the white car is the same Hyundai Elantra they are seeking. A Facebook group dedicated to the Idaho murders exclusively shared haunting surveillance footage with Fox News Digital that showed Goncalves and Mogen hours before they were killed. IDAHO MURDERS: FULL VIDEO APPEARING TO SHOW KAYLEE GONCALVES AND MADISON MOGEN HOURS BEFORE SLAYINGS RELEASED The best friends are walking in downtown Moscow with a man who looks like the same student in a hoodie seen in a video moments later standing near them when they ordered pasta from a Grub truck. The women are discussing someone named Adam, who the Goncalves' family lawyer said is a bartender. A newly leaked image shows Goncalves and Mogen hanging out at the Corner Club bar in downtown Moscow before returning home in the early hours of Nov. 13. It appears to have been taken by a security camera inside the bar. If the timestamp is accurate, it would have been taken at 1:32 a.m. Washington State University PhD student Bryan Christopher Kohberger was arrested in eastern Pennsylvania on an Idaho warrant, charging him with four counts of first-degree murder and felony burglary.\u00a0 IDAHO MURDER SUSPECT: WHO IS BRYAN CHRISTOPHER KOHBERGER? Kohberger, 28, was studying at the college's department of criminal justice and criminology in Pullman, Washington \u2014 about 8 miles from the King Road home where the victims were knifed to death. The FBI and local police arrested Kohberger at what appears to be his parents' home in a gated community in Albrightsville, Pennsylvania, according to a police report. A search warrant was executed Friday on Kohberger's Pullman apartment. At a press conference announcing the break in the case, police said they had recovered a Hyundai Elantra but did not confirm whether it belonged to Kohberger.\u00a0 Latah County Prosecutor Bill Thompson said the court documents outlining the details of the crime would remain sealed until Kohberger is extradited to Idaho. Police also said that plans to clean the King Road home and release the property back to the owner had been halted by a \"legal request from the court.\" Authorities are asking anyone with information about the murders to contact 208-883-7180 or tipline@ci.moscow.id.us.

        "content": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday issued a new directive raising the maximum rate that lawmakers can pay House staff to $212,100 annually \u2014 $38,000 more than what members of Congress make.\u00a0 The move comes after Pelosi already issued a directive earlier this year raising the maximum pay staffers can make from $199,300 to $203,700. At the time, Pelosi also instituted a minimum salary level of $45,000 for House staff.\u00a0 The move was seen as precedent-breaking since for decades there were no official House rules governing staffer pay. Instead, House offices were free to negotiate staff pay individually. HOUSE QUICKLY APPROVES $1.7T SPENDING BILL, FLEES DC FOR CHRISTMAS BREAK Pelosi, who is set to relinquish the speaker's gavel when the new Republican Congress takes office on Tuesday, said the move would help Congress retain quality staff who might otherwise be lured by private-sector employment.\u00a0 \"As you know, our hard-working, patriotic congressional staffers are integral to the functioning of the House of Representatives,\" Pelosi, D-Calif., wrote in a letter to House lawmakers. \"To that end, we must do all we can to retain and recruit the best talent in our nation \u2014 and to build a congressional workforce that reflects the communities we are honored to serve.\"\u00a0 The new salary cap means that senior staffers can make more annually than the lawmakers who serve as their employees. Both House and Senate lawmakers are paid $174,000 annually.\u00a0 Pelosi said the pay hike brings the maximum salary available for house staffers in line with President Biden's administration.  Before the new minimum pay rule, there was a wide pay divergence between offices, according to a report by the centrist advocacy group Issue One.\u00a0 The group found that some offices, most notably run by progressive Democrats, have wide-ranging pay scales with interns even making as much as $15 per hour. Other offices, meanwhile, paid junior staffers salaries below $30,000 per year. Overall, Issue One found one out of eight congressional offices were not paying wages that are comparable to the cost of living in Washington, D.C. The report estimated that there were roughly 1,200 congressional staffers making less than $42,610 annually.\u00a0",

        "content": "An ex-staffer for Democrat Rep. Katie Porter of California alleged that the congresswoman made rude and racist comments to staff and said that she \"ridiculed people for reporting sexual harassment.\" Sasha Georgiades, a Navy veteran and former Wounded Warrior fellow for Porter, also alleged that she heard the progressive congresswoman use racial slurs when talking to staff. Porter is currently facing scrutiny after leaked text messages showed her berating Georgiades for catching the coronavirus.\u00a0 Georgiades also said that Porter ridiculed people after they had reported sexual harassment in her office as well as \"made fun of individuals whose parents passed away from COVID.\" DEM REP. KATIE PORTER UNDER FIRE FOR TREATMENT OF VETERAN FELLOW AS FORMER STAFFER DECRIES CULTURE OF FEAR \"Basically told the individual to grow up,\" Georgiades said regarding the case of a staffer who had reported sexual harassment in Porter\u2019s office. Georgiades noted that the staffer, who worked with her during her two-year period in Porter\u2019s office, left the office shortly \"after the sexual harassment conversation\" with the congresswoman. She also noted the individual \"hasn\u2019t filed anything with ethics committee but spoke about it with [Porter] personally, and that was her response.\" The Navy veteran recalled a Facebook live event around the time of Porter\u2019s COVID-19 infection in July \u2014 which Georgiades previously told Fox News Digital excommunicated her from the office for violating \"office protocols\" \u2014 where the office communications director \"had set up the ring light and iPad, and then Katie came in and completely dressed her down in front of me.\" Georgiades said that Porter had ridiculed her communications director because \"she hadn\u2019t set the ring light up correctly according to Katie and didn\u2019t put the iPad in the right place so Katie would look good, and she was telling her basically there was no reason for her to even have a job if she had to just come in and fix everything.\" She added that the communications director had almost cried because Porter \"made her feel so bad.\" Georgiades also said she heard Porter badmouthing Democrat leadership and that the progressive Democrat \"has stated that she thinks Republicans have better policies.\" Porter's office did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. A Twitter account called Dear White Staffers posted screenshots of conversations with anonymous ex-Porter staffers where the allegations of her saying \"rude/racist things\" while trying to \"mask it as edgy humor\" and badmouthing Democrat leadership. \"Thinks she knows better and talks s--- about other members, leadership, staffers, local [elected officials], etc., at full volume, in public, and to literally [anyone] who will listen,\" the post reads. The anonymous account also accused Porter of being \"completely disinterested\" in representing her district in Congress, adding that the only staffers who appear to \"survive are superfans that participate in or overlook the abuse.\" \"Give it time and it will rank among the legendary toxic offices,\" the post read. The claims come as Porter is hit by an avalanche of accusations following the Dear White Staffers account's initial post regarding Georgiades' excommunication from the congresswoman's office for violating \"office protocols\" by catching COVID-19. Porter has a history of controversial text messages that have surfaced, such as her berating of Irvine, California, Mayor Farrah Khan after the congresswoman trashed the Irvine police department following her violent town hall last year. In the texts, Porter criticized Khan, saying that she would not call the mayor after the arrest of Julian Willis after he allegedly punched a pro-Trump protester, giving the protester a bloody nose. \"You can lecture me on professionalism. And see what happens,\" Porter wrote in the texts, despite famously wearing a Batgirl Halloween costume to the House of Representatives on the same day Democrats voted for a resolution on ground rules for the impeachment inquiry surrounding then-President Donald Trump. The National Republican Congressional Committee and other Republicans mocked the costume on Twitter.",

        "description": "Changes to North Carolina's criteria for governors to declare states of emergency have been included in a budget law in response to Gov. Roy Cooper's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "content": "The new year will place new hurdles in the path of North Carolina's current and future governors before states of emergency they issue can extend into months or even years, as happened during the COVID-19 pandemic. A provision in the 2021 state budget law that takes effect Sunday requires governors to gain formal support from other elected officials for their short-term emergency declarations to last beyond 30 days. It's among a dozen state laws taking effect in part or in full as 2023 begins. The laws include an income tax cut, the creation of a new Department of Adult Correction and new directives to prevent the sale of stolen goods on online marketplaces. CANADA'S TRUDEAU DEFENDS USING EMERGENCY POWERS TO SHUT DOWN FREEDOM CONVOY PROTESTS The changes to emergencies are a response by Republican politicians and their allies to Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's authority to issue a coronavirus declaration in March 2020 and to extend it unilaterally on his own. Those orders served as the basis for governments to restrict retail business activity and public events, and to direct social distancing. Cooper ultimately ended the COVID-19 emergency declaration in August \u2014 29 months later. Cooper had vetoed stand-alone bills limiting his declaration powers, but he ultimately ceded some of his authority when he agreed to sign the massive 2021 state government budget law that included similar language. The new law says a governor now must receive formal support from a majority of the Council of State \u2014 composed of the lieutenant governor, attorney general and several other statewide elected executive positions \u2014 to extend the declaration beyond 30 days or it expires. The General Assembly would have to pass a law for the declaration to go beyond 60 days. Another finance provision in the 2021 budget law will cut the state individual income tax rate from 4.99% to 4.75%. It's part of a six-year effort that began in 2022 to reduce the rate from 5.25% to 3.99% in 2027. Most income earners will see the latest lower rate reflected in how much tax is removed from their paychecks in 2023 and when they file their tax returns in early 2024. The budget law also directs and simplifies the business franchise tax in a way that should reduce the tax amount for North Carolina-based businesses. One tax that most motorists pay \u2014 on gasoline \u2014 will go up automatically starting Sunday from 38.5 cents per gallon to 40.5 cents. State law adjusts automatically the motor fuels tax annually based on changes in state population and broad energy costs. WATTERS: YOU THINK DEMS WILL GIVE UP THEIR EMERGENCY POWERS? A couple new laws have laid out the plan for government officials to move the state's prison and probation systems out from under the Department of Public Safety to the Cabinet-level adult correction agency. A similar stand-alone correction department was operating barely a decade ago before it was merged into the public safety department. Cooper has already picked previous state prisons commissioner Todd Ishee to become the new adult correction secretary. And another new law is designed to counter organized theft at retail stores by discouraging the sale of those stolen items by third parties on websites such as Amazon or Facebook. Provisions that took effect in December increased penalties for large-scale thefts. Starting in 2023, \"high-volume\" third-party sellers must provide certain contact and identifying information to a marketplace that they are using. The marketplace also must suspend sales when such a seller refuses to provide information or gives false information.",

        "content": "Dr. Anthony Fauci's wife Christine Grady serves in a leadership role overseeing bioethics research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a position that doesn't give her oversight of her husband's work. Earlier this week, Twitter CEO Elon Musk suggested that Grady's position gave her the authority to oversee work conducted by Fauci \u2014 who currently serves as the White House chief medical adviser and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) \u2014 and ensure he complied with agency ethics rules. The comment sparked confusion over whether there was a conflict of interest regarding Fauci's professional relationship with his wife. \"Almost no one seems to realize that the head of bioethics at NIH \u2013 the person who is supposed to make sure that Fauci behaves ethically \u2013 is his wife,\" Musk tweeted Wednesday. \"How do I not know this? That would be a big deal,\" Eric Weinstein, the managing director of Thiel Capital, responded. FAUCI SAYS \u2018IT\u2019S VERY IMPORTANT' TO LEARN COVID ORIGIN, EXPLAINS WHAT TO DO IF LAB LEAK THEORY PROVEN TRUE However, Fauci and Grady work in two different agencies which, while both overseen by the NIH, are separate entities.\u00a0 While Fauci leads NIAID, a key agency that oversees infectious disease research and policy, Grady is the chief of the Department of Bioethics at the NIH Clinical Center. The NIAID and Clinical Center are among the 27 different institutes and centers that are part of the NIH which itself is within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). In addition, Grady's office conducts bioethics research, not internal ethics investigations. The HHS has an independent inspector general which conducts internal investigations into operations at the NIH and its many institutes and centers. RAND PAUL PROMISES TO 'SUBPOENA EVERY LAST DOCUMENT OF DR. FAUCI' IN VICTORY SPEECH \"Dr. Grady is the Chief of Bioethics at the NIH Clinical Center and a member of the NIH research community,\" the NIH told Fox News Digital in a statement. \"To be clear, the Department of Bioethics is distinct from the NIH Ethics Program. The NIH Department of Bioethics in the NIH Clinical Center is a center for research, training, and services related to bioethical medical and research issues.\"\u00a0 \"The Department conducts conceptual, empirical, and policy-related research into bioethical issues; offers comprehensive training to future bioethicists and educational programs for biomedical researchers and clinical providers; and provides high quality ethics consultation services to clinicians, patients, and families of the NIH's Clinical Center and advice to the NIH IRBs, investigators, and others on the ethical conduct of research,\" the statement continued. \"The NIH Ethics Program assists NIH staff to meet the requirements of the statutes and regulations governing behavior of employees of the Federal Government.\" The Department of Bioethics was founded in 1996 and designed to serve as a \"premier center for bioethics to complement and inform the NIH's cutting-edge program of biomedical research.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fauci and Grady married in 1985 and have since held high-ranking positions in the federal government. While they have rarely appeared in public together, the pair took part in a discussion about the COVID-19 pandemic hosted by the Greenwall Foundation in November 2021. Fauci, who has been criticized for his handling of the pandemic as the nation's top infectious disease expert, announced in August that he would retire on Dec. 31.",

        "content": "The repeal of the military\u2019s vaccine mandate put this year\u2019s National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, in the spotlight.\u00a0The repeal, however, is just one of the many provisions attached to the $847 billion bill that outlines military policy and spending priorities. The NDAA also sets aside an additional $10.6 billion for activities outside of its jurisdiction, bringing its topline to about $858 billion.  President Joe Biden signed the measure into law\u00a0on Friday, December 23; among other things, it authorized sending $800 million to the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative and outlining $816.7 billion for the Department of Defense alone.  The bill also wades into military policy itself, limiting the Biden administration\u2019s own efforts to retire\u00a0the powerful B83 gravity bomb until the military identifies \"a suitable replacement,\" according to the Senate Committee on Armed Services. The B83 bomb is said to be 80 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, and the administration announced intentions to replace it in 2022 due to rising maintenance costs and limits on its abilities. But most Republican lawmakers oppose that effort. The ranking Republican on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, Colorado Congressman Doug Lamborn, says the bill \"restores funding for the nuclear C launched cruise missile and prohibits retirement of the B-83 gravity bomb. It replenishes American stocks of munitions that have been provided to Ukraine and have begun to be depleted.\" Additionally, the bill authorizes a 4.6 percent pay raise for service members and Department of Defense workforce, along with additional funding to account for inflation, which hit a 40-year high earlier this year.  Overall, the NDAA adds up to billions of dollars more than President Biden had originally requested. California Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi \u2013 the outgoing Speaker of the House - acknowledged high price tag but claims the costliest NDAA in history is necessary.\u00a0\"There\u2019s some reluctance about a higher defense bill, but our needs are greater,\" Pelosi said.  Defense funding has passed without fail every year since 1961, usually with overwhelming bipartisan support, though this year 11 senators voted against the bill. ",

Buttigieg has not made any official announcements if he will run for president in 2024. Due to severe winter storms sweeping the nation, thousands of flights across the country were canceled, with the majority being from Southwest Airlines.\u00a0 According to Fox 11, of the more than 160 flight cancelations at Los Angeles International Airport over the past few days alone, 106 of the cancelations were from Southwest flights. Sal Lagonia, an aviation attorney and pilot, said the amount of recent flight cancelations impacting thousands of American travelers is \"inexcusable.\" \"Frankly they are inexcusable. Weather was only one of the many reasons initially. However, as the other carriers recovered relatively quickly, Southwest did not. Their lack of upgraded systems is not acceptable,\" he said in an exclusive statement. While blasting Southwest for management failures, the pilot also placed blame for the air travel chaos on the DOT and Buttigieg, who said in September that the summer's air travel woes were \"gonna get better by the holidays.\" BUTTIGIEG UNDER FIRE FROM BOTH PARTIES AMID SOUTHWEST HOLIDAY TRVAEL FIASCO \"Once again Buttigieg was Missing in Action,\" Lagonia said. \"Similar to other such examples like the unloaded ships in the Pacific, Buttigieg shows that he is either unable or unwilling to give his full effort in tackling these issues which are a key component to his department. These are complex issues that require full effort and competent leadership.\" \"My reaction is that it's not all that big a surprise, except of course when it comes to Southwest. That mess represents the biggest airline computer meltdown I've ever seen. This issue sits solidly with Southwest. Not sure the Secretary can really do much to help at this\u00a0point,\" said Rob Mark, a pilot and flight instructor who serves as CEO of\u00a0CommAvia. Despite Buttigieg facing major backlash from the public, Mark believes that the responsibility falls on Southwest Airlines and their inability to properly schedule and manage flights.\u00a0 \"The big issue, I think, is not whether SWA replaces its software\u00a0to prevent another meltdown. They must. The big issue is how the airline takes care of the hundreds of thousands\u00a0of passengers they've inconvenienced.\" JP Tristiani, a former helicopter pilot, graduate of U.S. Naval Test Pilot School and longtime aviation specialist, said that despite Southwest having the right tools to avoid the situation, they \"totally failed with the snow storm they faced along their routes. Lost tract of crews and a/c stranded \u2018somewhere\u2019\u2026 Other airlines, majors, might have better computers that may have mitigated their exposure to the snow.\" \"From pilots I know still in the game, the opinion of him is 'not qualified,'\" Tristiani said of Buttigieg, highlighting the transportation secretary's proposals for more control and penalties against airlines. \"Government control outside the FAA, airline companies, unions will never, has never benefited air travelers or the airline route system, equipment, crew training, knowledge of scheduling, state of the art of such computers, etc.\" Buttigieg did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment, but released several statements over the past few days regarding the mass flight cancelations.\u00a0 \"USDOT is investigating, and we are enforcing customer service standards,\" Buttigieg wrote of the investigation into Southwest in a Twitter post on Thursday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Southwest Airlines also released several statements of apology following the flight catastrophes, pledging to address its failures, refund customers, and promising that scheduled flights will resume Friday.\u00a0",

Among those pardoned are a domestic abuse survivor convicted of murdering her husband and five others who served sentences for drug and alcohol-related charges. Biden has previously described America as \"a nation of laws and second chances, redemption, and rehabilitation.\" He has stated his commitment to pardoning individuals who have demonstrated their rehabilitation and served their communities. Such is the case for Beverly Ann Ibn-Tamas, an 80-year-old woman who was convicted of second-degree murder after shooting her husband dead in 1976, when she was 33. Ibn-Tamas, who was pregnant at the time, had testified that her husband physically and verbally abused her and threatened her.

In the country's last space launch of the year, a Long March 3B rocket lifted off from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center\u00a0in Sichuan Province, China. The rocket was carrying the Shiyan-10 02 satellite.\u00a0 The Philippine Space Agency, upon confirmation of the planned launch dates, said it immediately issued an advisory to all relevant government agencies on the estimated drop zone area and proposed the issuance of appropriate warnings on air and marine access. 2022 SPACE STORIES THAT ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD \"Based on the Notice to Airmen issued by the Civil Aviation Administration of China to the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, expected unburned debris, such as the rocket boosters and payload fairing, is projected to fall within a drop zone area located within the vicinity of Recto bank, approximately 137 kilometers from Ayungin Shoal and 200 kilometers from Quezon, Palawan,\" the agency explained. \"The unburned debris is designed to be discarded as the rocket enters outer space. While not projected to fall on land features or inhabited areas within the Philippine territory, falling debris poses danger and potential risk to ships, aircraft, fishing boats and other vessels that will pass through the drop zone.\" The actual drop zone area is subject to change due to factors including the Earth's rotation, weather and climate conditions.\u00a0 HUBBLE IMAGES SHOW STARS IN GLOBULAR CLUSTER GLEAMING WITH 'NEBULOSITY' In addition, there is a possibility for the debris to float around the area and wash toward nearby coastlines.\u00a0 The agency said that the possibility of an uncontrolled re-entry to the atmosphere of the rocket\u2019s upper stages returning from outer space cannot be ruled out.

        "description": "From the scientific discoveries of the James Webb Space Telescope to the operation of the Perseverance rover, here are the year's most out-of-this-world space stories.",
        "content": "From the successful scientific operations of NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope to the splashdown of the Orion space capsule, 2022 has seen a lot of wins. Here are the biggest moments to remember: NASA\u2019s Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission successfully altered the orbit of an asteroid millions of miles away. Following analysis over two weeks after the spacecraft struck Dimorphos \u2013 the first time humanity purposefully changed the motion of a celestial object and the first full-scale demonstration of asteroid deflection tech \u2013 scientists found that the kinetic impact had shortened the moonlet's orbit around its parent asteroid Didymos by 32 minutes. Before, Dimorphos took 11 hours and 55 minutes to orbit Didymos. The measure has a margin of uncertainty of approximately plus or minus two minutes. IMAGE FROM NASA'S WEBB TELESCOPE REVEALS EARLY STELLAR FORMATION IN 'RARE' FIND Astronomers unveiled the first image of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The colorized picture was produced by the international Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration, using observations from a worldwide network of radio telescopes. The black hole is about 27,000 light-years away from Earth and 4 million times more massive than our sun. NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover is expected to begin building the first sample depot on another world. According to NASA, this will mark a crucial milestone in the Mars Sample Return campaign, which aims to bring Mars samples to Earth for closer study. Over the course of around 30 days, Perseverance will deposit a total of 10 tubes that carry samples representing the diversity of the rock record in Jezero Crater. STRIKING NASA IMAGES REVEALS IO'S VOLCANO-LACED SURFACE NASA's Orion space capsule splashed down in the ocean after a 25-day uncrewed test flight around the moon, concluding a mission that paves the way for astronauts on the next lunar flyby. The capsule splashed down west of Baja California, more than 300 miles south of the original target zone. NASA and its international partners released the full series of James Webb Space Telescope's first full-color images and data. The pictures include the WASP-96 b exoplanet, which is a hot, gaseous giant located nearly 1,150 light-years from Earth. In another shot shared via an international broadcast, the Southern Ring, or \"Eight-Burst,\" planetary nebula is shown in greater detail, which was previously hidden from astronomers. Next, in an image presented by European Space Agency (ESA) partners, Stephan's Quintet \u2013 a visual grouping of five galaxies \u2013 is seen in a new light, about 290 million light-years away. The final image showed the glittering vista of the Carina Nebula \u2013 a stellar nursery \u2013 with brand-new stars that were previously completely hidden. The \"Cosmic Cliffs\" captured by Webb are the edge of the giant, gaseous cavity within the Carina Nebula's star-forming region called NGC 3324. The Carina Nebula, found within the Milky Way, is approximately 7,600 light-years away. It is home to many massive stars that are several times larger than the sun. Since then, the telescope has helped astronomers uncover the earliest galaxies confirmed to date. NASA astronaut Nicole Mann made history as the first Native American woman to launch into space. Mann, a member of the Wailacki of the Round Valley Indian Tribes, traveled to the International Space Station as commander of NASA\u2019s SpaceX Crew-5 mission aboard the SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft. Axiom Mission 1, the first private crewed mission to the International Space Station (ISS), launched in April. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon Endeavour lifted off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The Ax-1 mission sent four private space travelers on a 10-day flight to conduct science and push the boundaries of commercial spaceflight.

        "content": "NASA's Hubble Space Telescope snapped a pair of \"dazzlingly different\" images of a brilliant star cluster some 160,000 light years away. Globular cluster NGC 1850, in the constellation Dorado, is approximately 63,000 times the mass of the sun, is 100 million years old and is located in the Large Magellanic\u00a0Cloud, NASA said in a news release. A birthplace for billions of stars, the Large Magellanic\u00a0Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. The agency said that the telescope used filters with specific assigned colors to study particular wavelengths of light emanating from NGC 1850 and its surrounding stars. NASA\u2019S MARS ROVER DEPOSITS FIRST SAMPLE ON RED PLANET FOR POSSIBLE RETURN TO EARTH One image with blue nebulosity includes near-infrared light as well as visible light, while the other with red nebulosity covers the near-ultraviolet to the beginnings of the infrared spectrum. NGC 1850 is a spherical collection of densely packed stars held together by mutual gravitational attraction, the release said. However, unlike most globular clusters,\u00a0its stars are relatively young. According to scientists, the theory is that the first generation of stars in the globular cluster ejected matter into the surrounding cosmos when they were born. IMAGE FROM NASA'S WEBB TELESCOPE REVEALS EARLY STELLAR FORMATION IN 'RARE' FIND However, the density of the cluster was so high that the matter could not escape its gravitational pull, causing it to stay nearby, and the gravity of the cluster also pulled in hydrogen and helium gas from its surroundings. The sources of gas created a second generation of stars, increasing both the density and size of the globular cluster. The presence of a black hole was found in NGC 1850 and there are also around 200 red giants and many brighter blue stars. Surrounding the cluster is a pattern of nebulosity, diffuse dust and gas theorized to come from supernova blasts.",

        "content": "NASA's InSight Mars Lander has recorded its biggest quake on Mars ever.\u00a0 According to new research published in the American Geophysical Union (AGU) journal Geophysical Research Letters, the international team said on the Earth night of May 4, the lander's seismometer detected a quake that was at least five times as big as the next largest one recorded on the red planet.\u00a0 \"This was definitely the biggest marsquake that we have seen,\" Taichi Kawamura, lead author and planetary scientist at the Institut de physique du globe de Paris, France, said in a release.\u00a0 Co-author and seismologist John Clinton, of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z\u00fcrich,\u00a0said the energy released by the single marsquake is equivalent with the cumulative energy from all other marsquakes seen thus far. NASA'S MARS LANDER INSIGHT TRANSMITS POTENTIAL FINAL IMAGE OF THE RED PLANET AS ITS POWER DWINDLES Clinton, who is a co-leader with Kawamura\u00a0at the marsquake service, said the waves recorded at InSight were so big that they almost saturated the seismometer. The waves from the marsquake last for about 10 hours.\u00a0 No previous marsquake's waves had exceeded the length of an hour. The previous biggest tremor, recorded in August 2021, was around a magnitude of 4.2, while the May quake had a magnitude of 4.7. The epicenter of the quake was outside the most seismically active region\u00a0on Mars.\u00a0 This seismic event was also rare in that it exhibited characteristics of both high- and low-frequency quakes.\u00a0 The data from this large quake were released in October by the Mars Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS) data service, NASA Planetary Data System (PDS) and the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), together with the marsquake service catalog. IMAGE FROM NASA'S WEBB TELESCOPE REVEALS EARLY STELLAR FORMATION IN 'RARE' FIND Seismology on Mars can help researchers better understand what's underneath its surface and its evolution.\u00a0 Most marsquakes are believed to occur due to fault movements. InSight is thought to be near its operational end because dust has progressively covered its solar panels and reduced its power.\u00a0 \"We are impressed that almost at the end of the extended mission, we had this very remarkable event,\" Kawamura said.\u00a0 Based on the data gathered from the marsquake, \"I would say this mission was an extraordinary success,\" he continued. \"My power\u2019s really low, so this may be the last image I can send.

        "content": "Negotiators reached a historic deal at a U.N. biodiversity conference early Monday that would represent the most significant effort to protect the world\u2019s lands and oceans and provide critical financing to save biodiversity in the developing world. The global framework comes on the day the United Nations Biodiversity Conference, or COP15, is set to end in Montreal. China, which holds the presidency at this conference, released a new draft on Sunday that gave the sometimes contentious talks much-needed momentum. \"We have in our hands a package which I think can guide us as we all work together to halt and reverse biodiversity loss and put biodiversity on the path to recovery for the benefit of all people in the world,\" Chinese Environment Minister Huang Runqiu told delegates before the package was adopted to rapturous applause just before dawn. \"We can be truly proud.\" EASTER ISLAND STILL RECOVERING FROM OCTOBER WILDFIRE THAT DAMAGED MOAI STATUES The most significant part of the agreement is a commitment to protect 30% of land and water considered important for biodiversity by 2030, known as 30 by 30. Currently, 17% of terrestrial and 10% of marine areas are protected. The deal also calls for raising $200 billion by 2030 for biodiversity from a range of sources and working to phase out or reform subsidies that could provide another $500 billion for nature. As part of the financing package, the framework asks for increasing to at least $20 billion annually by 2025 the money that goes to poor countries. That number would increase to $30 billion each year by 2030. Financing emerged late in the talks and risked derailing an agreement. Several African countries held up the final deal for almost nine hours. They wanted the creation of a new fund for biodiversity but agreed to the creation of one under the pre-existing Global Environmental Facility. \"Creating a fund under the GEF is the best way to obtain something immediate and efficient,\" said Christophe B\u00e9chu, France\u2019s minister for ecological transition who headed its delegation, adding that a completely new fund would have taken several years to establish and deprived developing countries of immediate cash for biodiversity. Then as the agreement was about to be adopted, Congo stood up and said it opposed the deal because it didn\u2019t set up that special biodiversity fund to provide developing countries with $100 billion by 2030. Huang swept aside the opposition and the documents that make up the framework were adopted. The convention\u2019s legal expert ruled Congo never formally objected to the document. Several other African countries, including Cameroon and Uganda, sided to no avail with Congo and said they would lodge a complaint. \"Many of us wanted more things in the text and more ambition but we got an ambitious package,\" Canada\u2019s Minister of Environment and Climate Change Steven Guilbeault said. \"We have 30 by 30. Six months ago, who would have thought we could 30 by 30 in Montreal? We have an agreement to halt and reverse biodiversity loss, to work on restoration, to reduce the use of pesticides. This is tremendous progress.\" France's B\u00e9chu called it a \"historical deal.\" JAMAICA REIMPOSES 'STATE OF EMERGENCY,' TOURISM INDUSTRY THREATENED BY HIGH CRIME RATE \"It's not a small deal. It's a deal with very precise and quantified objectives on pesticides, on reduction of loss of species, on eliminating bad subsidies,\" he said. \"We double until 2025 and triple 2030 the finance for biodiversity.\" The ministers and government officials from about 190 countries have mostly agreed that protecting biodiversity has to be a priority, with many comparing those efforts to climate talks that wrapped up last month in Egypt. Climate change coupled with habitat loss, pollution and development have hammered the world\u2019s biodiversity, with one estimate in 2019 warning that a million plant and animal species face extinction within decades \u2014 a rate of loss 1,000 times greater than expected. Humans use about 50,000 wild species routinely, and 1 out of 5 people of the world\u2019s 8 billion population depend on those species for food and income, the report said. But they struggled for nearly two weeks to agree on what that protection looks like and who will pay for it. The financing has been among the most contentious issues, with delegates from 70 African, South American and Asian countries walking out of negotiations Wednesday. They returned several hours later. Brazil, speaking for developing countries during the week, said in a statement that a new funding mechanism dedicated to biodiversity should be established and that developed countries provide $100 billion annually in financial grants to emerging economies until 2030. PERU GOVERNMENT REOPENS RAILS TO MACHU PICCHU AMID STATE OF EMERGENCY WITH AMERICAN TOURISTS STRANDED \"All the elements are in there for a balance of unhappiness which is the secret to achieving agreement in U.N. bodies,\" Pierre du Plessis, a negotiator from Namibia who is helping coordinate the African group, told The Associated Press before the vote. \"Everyone got a bit of what they wanted, not necessarily everything they wanted.\" There were supporters of the framework who said it fell short in several areas. The Wildlife Conservation Society and other environmental groups were concerned that the deal puts off until 2050 a goal of preventing the extinction of species, preserving the integrity of ecosystems and maintaining the genetic diversity within populations. They fear that timeline is not ambitions enough. Some advocates also wanted tougher language around subsidies that make food and fuel so cheap in many parts of the world. The document only calls for identifying subsidies by 2025 that can be reformed or phased out and working to reduce them by 2030. \"The new text is a mixed bag,\" Andrew Deutz, director of global policy, institutions and conservation finance for The Nature Conservancy, said. \"It contains some strong signals on finance and biodiversity but it fails to advance beyond the targets of 10 years ago in terms of addressing drivers of biodiversity loss in productive sectors like agriculture, fisheries, and infrastructure and thus still risks being fully transformational.\"",

        "content": "The James Webb Space Telescope team announced Thursday that scientists had discovered dozens of energetic jets and outflows from young stars previously hidden by dust clouds in one of the $10 billion-dollar observatory's iconic first images.\u00a0 In a release, NASA said that the \"rare\" find \u2013 including a paper published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society\u00a0this month \u2013 marks the beginning of a new era of investigating star formation, as well as how radiation from nearby massive stars might affect the development of planets. The Carina Nebula's Cosmic Cliffs, within the star cluster NGC 3324, is seen in a new wavelength with Webb and the telescope's capabilities allow researchers to track the movement of other features previously captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. Analyzing data from a specific wavelength of infrared light, astronomers discovered two dozen previously unknown outflows from extremely young stars revealed by molecular hydrogen.\u00a0 STRIKING NASA IMAGES REVEALS IO'S VOLCANO-LACED SURFACE Molecular hydrogen is a vital ingredient in stellar formation and a good way to trace the early stages of that process.\u00a0 \"As young stars gather material from the gas and dust that surround them, most also eject a fraction of that material back out again from their polar regions in jets and outflows. These jets then act like a snowplow, bulldozing into the surrounding environment. Visible in Webb\u2019s observations is the molecular hydrogen getting swept up and excited by these jets,\" NASA explained.\u00a0 Objects were discovered: including \"small fountains\" and \"burbling behemoths that extend light-years from the forming stars.\" RUSSIAN SPACE CAPSULE LEAK LIKELY DUE TO MICROMETEORITE STRIKE, OFFICIAL SAYS Previous observations of jets and outflows looked mostly at nearby regions and more evolved objects that are already detectable in Hubble's wavelengths. \"The unparalleled sensitivity of Webb allows observations of more distant regions, while its infrared optimization probes into the dust-sampling younger stages. Together this provides astronomers with an unprecedented view into environments that resemble the birthplace of our solar system,\" the agency noted. Many of these protostars are set to become low-mass stars, like the sun. This period of star formation, NASA added, is particularly hard to capture because it's relatively fleeting. Webb's observations are also help astronomers shed light on how active the star-forming regions are. By comparing the position of previously known outflows in this region to Hubble data from 16 years ago, the scientists were able to track the speed and direction in which the jets are moving.",

        "description": "NASA scientists said this week that they would continue to focus on Io, Jupiter's volcano-laced moon, with multiple close flybys of their Juno spacecraft.",
        "content": "NASA's Juno spacecraft's mission to Jupiter has set its sights on the moon Io.\u00a0 The agency said in a release, sharing a striking image of the moon's volcano-laced surface captured in the infrared by the Jovian Infrared Auroral Mapper this summer, that it was scheduled to image the Jovian moon on Thursday.\u00a0 The Dec. 15 flyby was the first of nine, with two of them just 930 miles away.\u00a0 The July 5 photo was captured as the spacecraft flew by at a distance of about 50,000 miles, with brighter spots indicating where temperatures were higher. RUSSIAN SPACE CAPSULE LEAK LIKELY DUE TO MICROMETEORITE STRIKE, OFFICIAL SAYS \"The team is really excited to have Juno\u2019s extended mission include the study of Jupiter\u2019s moons. With each close flyby, we have been able to obtain a wealth of new information,\" Juno Principal Investigator Scott Bolton, of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, said in a statement. \"Juno sensors are designed to study Jupiter, but we\u2019ve been thrilled at how well they can perform double duty by observing Jupiter\u2019s moons.\" Io, the most volcanically active world in the solar system,\u00a0will remain an object of the Juno team\u2019s attention for the next year and a half.\u00a0 Now in the second year of its mission to investigate Jupiter's interior, the solar-powered Juno had previously performed close flybys of Ganymede last year and Europa earlier in 2022. NASA said Juno scientists will use those flybys to perform the first high-resolution monitoring campaign on the magma-encrusted moon, studying Io\u2019s volcanoes and how volcanic eruptions interact with Jupiter\u2019s powerful magnetosphere and aurora. GEMINID METEOR SHOWER FAST FACTS The moon \u2013 which is a bit larger than Earth's moon \u2013 has hundreds of volcanoes, some erupting lava fountains dozens of miles\u00a0high.\u00a0 Its remarkable activity is the result of a tug-of-war between Jupiter's powerful gravity and smaller but precisely timed pulls from Europa and Ganymede. Io was discovered in 1610 by famed Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. The discovery, along with three other Jovian moons, was the first time a moon was discovered orbiting a planet other than Earth.\u00a0",
