        "text": "Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.\n\nKYIV \u2014 Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine has created some unexpected victims: the country\u2019s oligarchs.\n\nUkraine has long been considered one of the most corrupt countries on Earth and the couple of dozen businessmen who controlled a vast proportion of its wealth, as well as TV stations, mines, banks, shops, farms, real estate and more are seen as key contributors.\n\nOne of their number \u2014 chocolate baron Petro Poroshenko \u2014 even served as president from 2014 to 2019.\n\nBut Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has played havoc with their fortunes. The vast metalworks in Mariupol owned by Rinat Akhmetov have been turned into smoking ruins, farmland stands idle and is pocked with landmines, factories aren\u2019t working because of power cuts and seaborne exports have shriveled.\n\nThe political influence of the super-rich has also taken a tumble.\n\nEven before the war, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy promoted a de-oligarchization law aimed at limiting their political influence.\n\nThe war has strengthened that effort. Zelenskyy no longer needs the political and financial backing of oligarchs, and the searing experience of defending the country against Russian aggression is likely to make Ukrainians less keen to again kowtow to the mega-wealthy. Cutting corruption and strengthening the rule of law is also a condition for much of the aid pouring into Ukraine.\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how the war with Russia has changed the financial and political fortunes of five major Ukrainian businessmen.\n\nRinat Akhmetov\n\nRinat Akhmetov | Daniel Naupold/EPA\n\nUkraine\u2019s richest man, Akhmetov is paying a high price for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe backbone of his business empire \u2014 the metallurgical conglomerate Metinvest \u2014 lost two of its major plants in southern Ukraine. Azovstal steelworks and the Ilyich Iron and Steel Works were turned into piles of rubble by Russian forces during the assault on Mariupol.\n\nIn June, he filed a lawsuit against Russia in the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nSince the start of the war, his other assets \u2014 including power plants, banks, farms, mining and processing plants \u2014 have been either damaged or seized by Russian forces.\n\nAkhmetov\u2019s companies have been stumping up cash and resources to help in the war effort, providing more than $100 million in body armor and helmets, materials for fortifications, vehicles for the military, food kits and medicines for civilians.\n\nAccording to Akhmetov\u2019s spokesperson, he returned to Ukraine the day before Russia\u2019s invasion.\n\n\u201cHe met the beginning of the war at home, in Kyiv. Since then, he has not left Ukraine for a day,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian edition of Forbes, Akhmetov\u2019s fortune shrank from almost $14 billion in January to $4.3 billion in December, but he\u2019s still Ukraine\u2019s wealthiest person.\n\n\u201cBecause intense military action and rocket attacks in Ukraine unfortunately continue on an almost daily basis, no accurate and full calculation of losses is possible at this stage, and estimates may be incorrect and inconclusive,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nIn 2021, Zelenskyy accused him of trying to stage a coup, a charge Akhmetov strongly denied. Since the invasion, he\u2019s handed over his media licenses (to praise from Zelenskyy) and his full-throated support of the war effort is buying him some support.\n\nOligarch ranking:\n\nViktor Pinchuk\n\nViktor Pinchuk | Natalia Slipchuk/AFP via Getty Images\n\nSince the start of Russia\u2019s invasion, Viktor Pinchuk has actively urged Western nations to beef up their military support and criticized some countries, like Germany, for foot dragging.\n\nBy late September, the oligarch had spent more than $45 million on support for Ukraine\u2019s army and civilians, according to his charitable foundation.\n\nIn the first weeks of the war, when Russian troops were nearing Kyiv, paramedics were stationed in Pinchuk\u2019s luxurious mansion in the suburbs of the Ukrainian capital.\n\nThe oligarch\u2019s business empire \u2014 built around pipe and railway wheel manufacturer Interpipe \u2014 suffered less than other oligarchs\u2019 businesses.\n\n\u201cThe holding company\u2019s financial situation has worsened, but you can\u2019t say it\u2019s a disaster,\u201d said Alexander Paraschiy, head of research at Ukrainian consultancy Concorde Capital.\n\n\u201cThey were more affected not so much by the hostilities as by the hikes in energy prices and problems with logistics,\u201d he explained as the war has cut Interpipe\u2019s ability to export by sea.\n\nHis wealth has fallen from $2.6 billion to $2 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nPinchuk\u2019s media office did not reply to a request for comment.\n\nOligarch ranking:\n\nPetro Poroshenko\n\nFormer President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko | Pierre Crom/Getty Images\n\nBefore the war, Poroshenko was fighting for his political life, facing accusations of high treason and abetting terrorism. According to state prosecutors, Poroshenko allegedly favored supplies of coal from rebel-controlled areas of the Donbas region instead of coal produced in South Africa.\n\nDespite his protestations of innocence, some of his assets and property were seized by a Kyiv court.\n\nBut after the invasion, TV stations controlled by Poroshenko toned down their criticism of Zelenskyy.\n\n\u201cOn the first day of the Russian aggression, February 24, I came to Zelenskyy and said: \u2018I\u2019m not the opposition leader anymore. Both you and I are soldiers. Until our victory, I will not criticize anybody,\u2019\u201d he said in an interview with VOA.\n\nPoroshenko, who favored nationalistic policies when he was president, also donned military garb and organized groups of volunteers to help in the war \u2014 although Zelenskyy\u2019s office has accused him of unnecessary PR.\n\nPoroshenko\u2019s companies spent more than $46 million to support the armed forces, said his spokesperson. He\u2019s delivered armored vehicles purchased in Italy and Britain, four-wheel drive pickups, bulletproof vests, helmets, fuel and more.\n\nForbes says his fortune has fallen from $1.6 billion to $700 million.\n\nPoroshenko\u2019s media office refused to comment on the loss of his businesses and personal fortune caused by the war.\n\nOligarch ranking:\n\nIhor Kolomoisky\n\nIhor Kolomoyskyi | WikiCommons\n\nKolomoisky was seen as Zelenskyy\u2019s key original backer \u2014 using his powerful TV stations to promote the popular actor and comedian during the 2019 presidential election.\n\nHowever, close links to the new leader didn\u2019t save Kolomoisky from problems.\n\nIn January, the U.S. Department of Justice alleged Kolomoisky and an associate had laundered funds in the U.S. His lawyers reject any wrongdoing.\n\nHis main financial asset, Privatbank, was seized by Ukrainian authorities seven years ago after regulators found a $5 billion hole in its books, and Kolomoisky is still fighting for its return.\n\n\u201cKolomoisky has a very little chance of getting anything back through court,\u201d said Paraschiy from Concorde Capital.\n\nIn July, Zelenskyy reportedly took steps to strip Kolomoisky of his Ukrainian citizenship because he also has Israeli and Cypriot passports. Kolomoisky is fighting the decision.\n\nIn November, the Ukrainian government invoked wartime laws to take control of stakes in the nation\u2019s leading energy company Ukrnafta, partially controlled by Kolomoisky.\n\nKolomoisky did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOligarch ranking:\n\nViktor Medvedchuk\n\nViktor Medvedchuk | Sergei Supinsky/AFP via Getty Images\n\nViktor Medvedchuk, worth $620 million before the war, was the most influential pro-Russian oligarch in Ukraine; Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly his daughter\u2019s godfather.\n\nHis coziness with the Kremlin backfired.\n\nBefore Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, Medvedchuk was under arrest and facing investigation over possible high treason on accusations of cooperating with Russia over illegal gas extraction in the Black Sea, as well as coal supplies from rebel-controlled territories of the Donbas region.\n\nMedvedchuk escaped from house arrest after the invasion but was recaptured while trying to leave the country disguised as a military volunteer.\n\nIn September, he was swapped for Ukrainian prisoners of war held by the Russians. His current whereabouts are unknown.\n\nCroatia also seized his $200 million superyacht, the Royal Romance, which will be auctioned off to benefit Ukraine.\n\nOligarch ranking:",

According to the secretary general, \u201cthat's the only way to convince Russia that they have to sit down and negotiate in good faith and respect Ukraine as a sovereign independent nation in Europe.\u201d\n\n\"What we do know is that what Ukraine can achieve around that table is totally dependent on the strength on the battlefield,\" he stressed.\n\nOn Friday, Stoltenberg claimed that while \u201cit may sound paradoxical,\u201d Western military support for Ukraine is \"the quickest way to peace.\u201d\n\nFollowing the start of Russia\u2019s military operation in late February, Western countries have ramped up their weapons shipments to Ukraine, a move that has been condemned by Moscow. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that NATO was using the military potential of nearly all of its member states against Moscow in Ukraine. According to the president, efforts to undermine the Russian economy in the \u201csanctions war\u201d over Ukraine have largely failed.\n\nEarlier, he also accused the West of turning Ukraine into \u201ca colony\u201d, and using its people as \u201ccannon fodder, a battering ram against Russia.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the Kremlin maintains it is open to talks with Ukraine, accusing Kiev of refusing to negotiate. However, Moscow has insisted that Kiev must \u201crecognize the reality on the ground\u201d as a prerequisite for any peace talks, including the new status of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye as parts of Russia.",

Two Tu-160M aircraft have also been submitted for flight tests. One of them is an upgraded version of an existing plane, while the other had been built from scratch, as part of Russia\u2019s recent efforts to restart its strategic plane-manufacturing program.\n\nLast month, Ukraine made at least two attempts to strike airfields that host long-range aviation crews, deep inside Russian territory, in Saratov and Ryazan regions. According to the Defense Ministry, the modified \u201cSoviet-made\u201d jet drones, which targeted the Engels and Dyagilevo bases, were shot down by air defenses. However, debris from the destroyed UAVs ended up killing six servicemen on the ground and on one occasion inflicted minor damage to two aircraft.",

        "text": "Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.\n\nPaul Taylor is a contributing editor at POLITICO.\n\nPARIS \u2014 Having crashed the Turkish economy and impoverished the middle class that he himself had enriched, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan is now dragging his country toward an unnecessary war and manipulating the courts against his rivals.\n\nIt\u2019s a ruthless drive by Erdo\u011fan to cling to power in 2023 \u2014 the centenary of the Turkish Republic \u2014 and let\u2019s hope he fails.\n\nTurkey\u2019s presidential election, set to be held on June 23, is arguably the most important \u2014 though by no means the fairest \u2014 vote in the world this year. It will determine whether this nation of 85 million citizens, on the hinge of Europe, Asia and the Middle East, will keep hurtling down the road toward being an authoritarian, expansionist power, or whether it chooses a more liberal, pluralistic path.\n\nFor the first time since Erdo\u011fan\u2019s conservative, Islamist-tinged Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power in 2002, there\u2019s a serious prospect of political change. Inflation is running at over 80 percent a year, the Turkish lira has plummeted against the dollar, and the government\u2019s popularity has sunk as economic hardship has risen.\n\nAccording to the polls, Erdo\u011fan \u2014 who has ruled with an increasingly autocratic hand after amending the constitution to create a made-to-measure presidential system \u2014 is in serious political trouble, with the AKP barely receiving 30 percent support.\n\nOf course, his response has been characteristically brutal on both the domestic and international fronts.\n\nDespite opposition from both Washington and Moscow, Erdo\u011fan has trumpeted preparations to send tanks into Syria, looking to dislodge Kurdish militias allied with the West in the fight against Islamic State militants, but that Ankara sees as linked to outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) guerrillas. He seems determined to complete a buffer zone on the other side of Turkey\u2019s southern border.\n\nMeanwhile, the Turkish president is also threatening to strike NATO ally Greece amid manufactured disputes over gas drilling, Cyprus, and the alleged \u201cmilitarization\u201d of Greek islands in the Aegean Sea \u2014 although the international economic and political cost of any such action makes it highly improbable.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine began, Erdo\u011fan has positioned Turkey as the indispensable mediator between Moscow and Kyiv, helping broker deals and hosting talks between U.S. and Russian security chiefs. He\u2019s also managed to support Ukraine \u2014 including with military drone sales \u2014 while maintaining trade and energy ties with Russia and without jeopardizing his personal relationship with President Vladimir Putin or incurring the West\u2019s wrath.\n\nIn the meantime, back at home, the Turkish president has used a justice system not quite noted for its independence to try to disqualify his most potent potential challengers.\n\nIstanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamo\u011flu \u2014 a popular figure from the secular center-left Republican People\u2019s Party (CHP), who could be a unifying opposition presidential candidate \u2014 has just been sentenced to more than two years in jail and banned from public office for \u201cinsulting public officials.\u201d For now, the ruling\u2019s suspended pending appeals, but Erdo\u011fan may try to expedite the judicial process, so his rival is barred from running.\n\nThe West would undoubtedly be relieved to see the back of Erdo\u011fan | Adem Altan/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAlso, over 100 politicians from the main pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic Party (HDP) remain on trial for alleged terrorism offenses, which could lead to the movement being outlawed. The HDP isn\u2019t part of the six-party opposition alliance, which is putting together a common electoral platform, ranging from the social-democratic left to the liberal center-right. However, it could emerge as the kingmaker if \u2014 as polls suggest \u2014 neither the AKP nor the opposition wins a majority in parliament.\n\nErdo\u011fan, a former Istanbul mayor, was himself on the receiving end of similar judicial harassment before the AKP triumphed in 2002. Sentenced to a year in jail for reading a supposedly Islamist poem, he was barred from running for office and made to wait before becoming prime minister.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen just how far this formidable campaigner is willing to go this time in terms of real military action to play the nationalist card in his struggle for reelection.\n\nIn 20 years, Erdo\u011fan has lurched from a policy of \u201czero problems with the neighbors\u201d to open or latent conflict with Syria, Greece, Israel, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Armenia. However, in recent months, he\u2019s begun a rapprochement with several of these adversaries \u2014 partly because the failure of the Turkish-supported Arab Spring uprisings has forced him to adjust his foreign policy, but also because he desperately needs Arab and Western capital to shore up the economy, gutted by his reckless policy of maintaining low interest rates.\n\nWhile public opinion is strongly nationalist in Turkey, a ground incursion into Syria that triggered a U.S. or Russian reaction, forcing Ankara to back down, could backfire on him \u2014 as could his crude use of the judiciary to sideline the opposition. On the other hand, a limited cross-border operation with few Turkish casualties could actually be acceptable to voters, in the same way Israel\u2019s regular strikes on Gaza in retaliation for Palestinian Hamas rocket attacks are seen as police operations rather than wars.\n\nThe coming months will thus be full of martial gesticulation, not least to mark the 100th anniversary of Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s foundation of a modern, secular republic over the ashes of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nSupporters of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamo\u011flu protest against the re-run of the mayoral election in 2019 | Bulent Kilic/AFP via Getty Images\n\nErdo\u011fan will want to project Turkey\u2019s restored clout in a multipolar world where medium-sized powers can wield more influence, as the U.S. and Russia are less willing or able to act as global policemen. But after interventions in Libya and in support for Azerbaijan against Armenia, he may well stop short of a ground assault in Syria, if the major powers continue to warn him.\n\nThe European Union, sadly, is likely to be a bystander rather than a force for moderation or change. The bloc is Turkey\u2019s biggest trade partner, but it has lost influence in Ankara, as the country\u2019s long-stalled EU accession process is moribund, and Brussels has to regularly buy Turkey off with assistance to keep nearly 4 million Syrian refugees on its soil rather than letting them flood into Greece.\n\nThe West would undoubtedly be relieved to see the back of Erdo\u011fan. But governments are hedging their bets, keeping lines of communication open to the strongman on the Bosphorus, and offering depressingly little public help to the opposition, even as they quietly pray for a more moderate, pro-Western Turkey come June.\n\nFingers crossed.",

        "text": "Investors should brace for another turbulent year in the financial markets, economists have warned as central banks fight inflation, China reopens its economy after Covid-19 restrictions and the Ukraine war pushes the global economy towards recession.\n\nThe first half of the new year is likely to be choppy, according to Wall Street predictions, after global markets suffered their biggest fall since the 2008 financial crisis last year.\n\nBut the US S&P 500 is still expected to end 2023 a little higher than it began the year. The average target of 22 strategists polled by Bloomberg has the S&P 500 ending 2023 at 4,078 points \u2013 about 6% higher than it ended 2022.\n\nEconomists predict the US Federal Reserve will slow its interest rate hikes this year, as the outlook for America\u2019s economy sours. US inflation has dropped back from its peak last summer, while the series of Fed rate hikes in 2022 has also cooled the housing market.\n\n\u201cWe believe that a period of sub-trend growth is inevitable, and recession risks are high as the lagged effects of tighter monetary policy work their way through the economy,\u201d said Brian Rose, senior US economist at UBS Global Wealth Management.\n\nMichael Antonelli, managing director and market strategist at investment bank Baird, predicted the Fed would end its hiking cycle in February, and \u201chit the pause button\u201d after one more rate rise. He also expects the US stock market to make gains during 2023, pointing out that two consecutive falls are \u201cvery rare\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe stock markets all about \u2018Are things getting better or are things getting worse?\u2019 I think they will get slightly better next year,\u201d Antonelli told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting any big gains, but I think next year will be somewhat positive,\u201d Antonelli added.\n\nDeutsche Bank predicts economic downturns this year, which will hit financial markets.\n\n\u201cWe see major stock markets plunging 25% from levels somewhat above today\u2019s when the US recession hits, but then recovering fully by year-end 2023, assuming the recession lasts only several quarters,\u201d Deutsche Bank analysts said in their 2023 World Outlook late last year.\n\nStrategists at Russell Investments believe a recession seems likely in 2023 and equity markets may struggle but remain hopeful a global economic recovery should be on the horizon by year-end.\n\nThe head of the International Monetary Fund has warned that this year is going to be \u201ctougher than the year we leave behind\u201d, with a third of the world\u2019s economy in recession. Kristalina Georgieva said it would be \u201cbecause the three big economies \u2013 the US, EU and China \u2013 are all slowing down simultaneously\u201d.\n\nA global downturn could prompt central banks to reverse some of the hefty interest rate rises implemented in the last year. Nikolaj Schmidt, chief international economist at investment management firm T. Rowe Price, predicts that central banks will ease monetary policy early in the second half of 2023.\n\n\u201cWe see the world plunging into a global recession in 2023. The recession is going to be the result of the immense monetary tightening the central banks have administered over the past 12 months. As a silver lining, it will sow the seeds for a substantial retracement of inflation,\u201d Schmidt said.\n\nAnalysts at investment bank Jefferies predict a global recession this year, but expect Asia could avoid an outright downturn. The region could benefit from a resurgence of tourism, as Chinese tourists begin to slowly return to travel.\n\n\u201cGlobal economic conditions continue to deteriorate as inflation remains high and market conditions tighten; however, Asia could be the best of a bad lot and avoid an outright recession. In the past shocks of the dotcom bust, and the GFC [Great Financial Crisis], Asia bounced back quickly, and we expect that it can do the same in 2023,\u201d analysts at Jefferies said.\n\nChina\u2019s decision to relax Covid-19 restrictions last month could ease global supply chain tensions, but may also lead to higher demand for commodities and energy, adding to inflation pressures.\n\nSign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day \u2013 we'll point you to the all the business news and analysis you need every morning Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, predicted that the FTSE 100\u2019s outperformance could stretch into the new year.\n\n\u201cIf the Chinese reopening brings along another bump in inflation due to higher energy and commodity prices, the FTSE 100 could continue offering a good shelter to those willing to hedge against an energy-led global inflation to temper the negative effects,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOf course, the biggest British companies do not reflect the underlying British economy, so the FTSE 100\u2019s good performance won\u2019t change the fact that smaller, and domestic focused companies will likely continue to suffer from high inflation, recession and perhaps another year of political turmoil as a cherry on top,\u201d she warned.\n\nKevin Boscher, CIO at investment services group Ravenscroft, is hopeful that the economic environment will turn more favourable as the year progresses, lifting markets.\n\n\u201cAlthough the outlook remains problematic, asset prices should rebound as falling inflation allows central banks to cease their monetary tightening with rates expected to fall in the second half of the year,\u201d Boscher said.\n\nPaul Glover, chief investment manager at NFU Mutual, suggested 2023 could \u201cpleasantly surprise investors\u201d, citing encouraging signs that inflation may have peaked.\n\nHe added that the UK market could benefit from its significant international revenue exposure, and the potential for takeover offers for UK companies.\n\nRussia\u2019s economy has already fallen into recession, and its economic crisis is likely to continue in 2023.\n\n\u201cHaving started a brutal war, Putin has no easy way out,\u201d said economists at Berenberg bank. \u201cUkraine and the free world are standing up to him. The expenses of war, the slow poison of sanctions, the flight of parts of the urban elite and the mounting costs of repression will be a worsening drag on Russia as long as Putin remains in power.\u201d",

Because the three big economies \u2013 the US, EU and China \u2013 are all slowing down simultaneously,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe expect one-third of the world economy to be in recession. Even countries that are not in recession, it would feel like recession for hundreds of millions of people,\u201d she added.\n\n2023 IMF PREDICTION: \u201cWe expect one-third of the world economy to be in recession,\u201d IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva tells @margbrennan. But, a strong U.S. labor market might help the world get through a difficult year, she says. pic.twitter.com/Vbhj478pFo \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) January 1, 2023\n\nIn October, the IMF cut its outlook for global economic growth in 2023, reflecting the continuing drag from the war in Ukraine as well as inflation pressures and the high interest rates engineered by central banks like the US Federal Reserve aimed at bringing those price pressures to heel.\n\nGeorgieva said that China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, is likely to grow at or below global growth for the first time in 40 years as Covid-19 cases surge following the dismantling of its ultra-strict zero-Covid policy.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in 40 years, China\u2019s growth in 2022 is likely to be at or below global growth,\u201d Georgieva said.\n\n2023 will be a difficult year for the world. The silver lining is we can use it to transform economies & accelerate change that\u2019s good for our climate, good for growth. At the IMF, we recognize our responsibility to be a force for good.

We see the labour market remaining quite strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is \u2026 a mixed blessing because if the labour market is very strong, the Fed may have to keep interest rates tighter for longer to bring inflation down,\u201d Georgieva said.\n\nThe US job market will be a central focus for Federal Reserve officials who would like to see demand for labour slacken to help undercut price pressures. The first week of the new year brings a raft of key data on the employment front, including Friday\u2019s monthly nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show the US economy minted another 200,000 jobs in December and the jobless rate remained at 3.7% \u2013 near the lowest since the 1960s.\n\nReuters contributed to this report",

And it is not beyond the realm of possibility that they say, \u2018Keep out, we\u2019re here, this is our territory.\u2019\u201d\n\nNelson cited Chinese aggression over islands in the South China Sea, where Beijing has established military bases, as evidence of its territorial ambition. \u201cIf you doubt that, look at what they did with the Spratly Islands,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year, China\u2019s space program put up an Earth-orbiting space station and has mounted several lunar orbiting and sample-retrieving missions. A third phase of the program, to establish an autonomous lunar research station near the Moon\u2019s south pole, is scheduled for 2025.\n\nIn December, the Chinese government offered its vision for a crewed lunar landing, space transportation, infrastructure and space governance. China has also announced the goal of landing taikonauts on the moon by the end of this decade.\n\nStudents listen to an introduction to the Chang'e 5 moon sample-return spacecraft, at the InnoTech Expo in Hong Kong, China, last month.

Future missions are designed toward establishing more activity on the moon. However, the US is also focused on Mars.\n\nUS military brass have also sounded alarm over Chinese militarization of space and attendant security concerns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible they could catch up and surpass us,\u201d Space Force Lt Gen Nina Armagno said on a visit to Australia. \u201cThe progress they\u2019ve made has been stunning \u2013 stunningly fast.\u201d\n\nBut Beijing has rejected some US interpretations of the motives behind China\u2019s space push. \u201cOuter space is not a wrestling ground,\u201d Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, told Politico.\n\nThe spokesman said that some US officials had \u201cspoken irresponsibly to misrepresent the normal and legitimate space endeavors of China\u201d.\n\n\u201cChina always advocates the peaceful use of outer space, opposes the weaponization of and arms race in outer space, and works actively toward building a community with a shared future for mankind in the space domain,\u201d the statement added.",

        "text": "And without a government program like Operation Warp Speed to develop second-generation vaccines and treatments, at-risk patients could be in danger of developing severe cases of Covid and flooding hospitals when the U.S. health care system is already strained, thanks to an influx of patients with an array of respiratory illnesses, including flu and RSV.\n\n\u201cJust because we have exited the emergency phase of the pandemic does not mean that Covid is over or that it no longer poses a danger,\u201d said Leana Wen, a public health professor at George Washington University and former Baltimore health commissioner. \u201cThere are millions of Americans who are vulnerable to severe illness.\u201d\n\nThe FDA pulled authorizations for four antibody treatments in 2022 as Omicron and its myriad subvariants wiped out their effectiveness. The treatments were geared toward adult and pediatric patients with mild-to-moderate Covid who were considered at risk of developing severe disease and ending up hospitalized.\n\nWhile antiviral pills are plentiful and remain an option for some with weak immune systems, they won\u2019t work for everyone \u2014 Pfizer\u2019s Paxlovid interacts with many widely prescribed drugs.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies \u2014 which have been made by companies like Regeneron, Eli Lilly and Vir \u2014 are lab-created molecules designed to block a virus\u2019 entry into human cells. But they must bind to the virus\u2019 spike protein to neutralize it, and the coronavirus\u2019 many mutations since its 2019 emergence have gradually rendered the available products ineffective.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit risky to develop this,\u201d said Arturo Casadevall of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, pointing to how quickly some Covid variants have surfaced before quickly receding.\n\nA massive spending bill that lawmakers passed before Christmas left out the administration\u2019s $9 billion request for more money to fight the pandemic, meaning there are fewer dollars to be spread around to address emerging Covid needs.\n\n\u201cDue to congressional inaction and a lack of funding, HHS does not have the resources it needs to fund the development of new treatments, and we could find ourselves with a very limited medicine cabinet at a time when we need more tools to combat Covid-19,\u201d a department spokesperson told POLITICO, adding that HHS is working with providers and other groups \u201cto ensure that Americans are able to take advantage of all available treatment options.\u201d\n\nThe Biden administration has strongly promoted oral antiviral regimens like Paxlovid, which debuted a year ago and marked a turning point in managing the virus for most Americans.\n\nImmunocompromised individuals \u2014 who are either born with immune-suppressing conditions or acquire them after organ transplants or by taking certain drugs \u2014 also may not mount sufficient immune responses after vaccination, making treatment options like antibody therapies a critical tool for them.\n\nA CDC alert issued Dec. 20 to clinicians and public health professionals warned of the lack of viable monoclonal antibody treatments \u2014 including the diminished efficacy of a prophylactic antibody, Evusheld \u2014 and the availability of the antiviral options that to date have seen lackluster uptake. The agency urged providers to consult the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Covid treatment guidelines for ways to potentially manage drug interactions with Paxlovid, such as temporary pauses or reductions in dose.\n\nRemdesivir, an antiviral administered intravenously, is another treatment option for the immunocompromised, but it requires infusions over three days in either hospital or outpatient settings. HHS is urging states to support its health departments and systems in setting up infusion clinics to expand access to remdesivir, especially on an outpatient basis, and is working with maker Gilead to broaden the types of providers eligible to buy the drug.\n\nCovid convalescent plasma remains an option for immunocompromised people who contract the virus, but its availability is scattershot across the country, Casadevall said. The treatment has pros and cons, he said \u2014 it\u2019s less likely to be defeated by any one variant and can adapt to different strains, but it\u2019s difficult to administer and requires blood-typing to be done for the recipient.\n\nStill, Casadevall said, the main issue is educational because its use has changed since the pandemic\u2019s early days, when treatments were scarce. Some hospital systems, like Hopkins, use it routinely, while some doctors don\u2019t know plasma is still an option, he said.\n\nThe FDA has authorized the emergency use of convalescent plasma containing high Covid antibody levels for immunocompromised patients. But NIH has remained neutral on the treatment in that population, which Janet Handal, president of the Transplant Recipients and Immunocompromised Patient Advocacy Group, says has led to some hospitals balking at administering it.\n\nNIH spokesperson Renate Myles pointed to the agency\u2019s treatment guidelines for Covid, which are developed by an expert panel.\n\nThe recommendations for Covid convalescent plasma, last updated on Dec. 1, say there\u2019s \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to recommend for or against the treatment\u2019s use in immunocompromised patients, while noting some panel members would use plasma to treat an immunocompromised person \u201cwith significant symptoms attributable to COVID-19 and with signs of active [viral] replication and who is having an inadequate response to available therapies.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn these cases, clinicians should attempt to obtain high-titer [Covid convalescent plasma] from a vaccinated donor who recently recovered from Covid-19 likely caused by a \u2026 variant similar to the variant causing the patient\u2019s illness,\u201d the guidelines say.\n\nCasadevall, who leads the Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma Project, says NIH\u2019s stance on plasma is inconsistent with its previous recommendations of monoclonal antibodies, which were made without clinical efficacy data, since Covid antibodies are the active component in both therapies. He led a petition earlier this month \u2014 signed by several doctors, including past and current presidents of the Infectious Diseases Society of America \u2014 asking NIH to change its recommendations.\n\nHandal\u2019s group also has asked the NIH and the White House to convene a meeting with scientists on the issue.\n\n\u201cTo just not be having a dialogue about it is infuriating to us,\u201d Handal said. \u201cPeople are dying while people are just going through this bureaucratic dance.\u201d\n\nThe FDA and European Medicines Agency held a virtual workshop this month to bring doctors, industry and regulators together to discuss supporting novel monoclonal antibody treatments.\n\n\u201cThe FDA is committed to working with industry sponsors to expedite the development of new drug products to meet unmet needs, such as the need for new preventive therapies for immune-suppressed patients who are unlikely to respond to vaccination,\u201d an agency spokesperson said.\n\nIn the meantime, Regeneron spokesperson Tammy Allen said the company, whose antibody cocktail\u2019s use was limited in January, is committed to evaluating antibody treatment options as the coronavirus evolves.\n\n\u201cWe believe monoclonal antibodies have played an important role in the COVID-19 pandemic to date and may again in the future, particularly among people with immunocompromising conditions,\u201d Allen said.\n\nVir, which partnered with GSK on sotrovimab, continues to study whether the treatment could work against emerging variants and is also evaluating next-generation antibodies and small-molecule therapies, said spokesperson Carly Scaduto.\n\nStill, pharmaceutical companies may be more inclined \u2014 both financially and practically \u2014 to pursue developing better antiviral pills that pose fewer drug interactions and are easier to administer, said Jason Gallagher, a clinical pharmacy specialist in infectious diseases at Temple University Hospital. Antivirals also hold up better against an ever-changing virus, he added.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s way more money in Paxlovid than there is in any monoclonal\u201d antibody treatment, Gallagher said, and it may take incentives to drugmakers to encourage their development. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to make anyone really rich.\u201d",

        "text": "Press play to listen to this article Voiced by artificial intelligence.\n\nBelgian investigators asked the European Parliament to waive the immunity of two more MEPs suspected of wrongdoing amid a sprawling corruption scandal linked to alleged bribery by Qatar and Morocco.\n\nSocialists & Democrats lawmakers Marc Tarabella, a Belgian MEP, and Andrea Cozzolino, an Italian, are those now being targeted, according to an EU official close to the matter, as well as an insider in the S&D group in the Parliament. Both spoke on condition of anonymity in order not to jeopardize the legal procedure. The Belgian prosecutor declined to provide comment.\n\nThe Parliament has vowed to crack down on corruption and illicit lobbying, deciding in December to establish a special committee to run in parallel with a probe by Belgian prosecutor Michel Claise. \u201cThere will be no impunity. None,\u201d wrote European Parliament President Roberta Metsola on Twitter.\n\nThis was a knowing nod to the NGO Fight Impunity, which former MEP Pier Antonio Panzeri established in 2019 with his former assistant Francesco Giorgi, who has worked as Cozzolino\u2019s assistant since 2019.\n\nThe immunity of Giorgi\u2019s partner, Eva Kaili, formerly one of the Parliament\u2019s 14 vice presidents, was automatically stripped away because she was considered to have been caught in the act of committing an offense. The Belgian prosecutor also found \u20ac150,000 in cash at her Brussels apartment after the scandal broke on December 9. Belgian authorities then arrested her and seized bags of cash in Brussels.\n\nMEPs removed Kaili as a vice president last month and along with Giorgi, former MEP Panzeri and NGO boss Niccol\u00f2 Fig\u00e0-Talamanca, she is now facing preliminary charges of corruption, money laundering and participation in a criminal organization.\n\nThe Parliament will officially kickstart the lengthy procedure for removing legal protection for Tarabella and Cozzolino when MEPs next gather in Strasbourg on January 16. At that time, the Parliament\u2019s legal affairs committee will give the two MEPs a chance to say their piece and rubber stamp the measure before handing it over to the entire plenary of lawmakers for a final vote, which will likely be an overwhelming majority.\n\nThe Socialists & Democrats group in Parliament said in a statement to POLITICO that its members would \u201cfollow, in the context of the European Parliament, the procedures foreseen in a responsible and constructive manner.\u201d\n\nIn a separate statement shared with POLITICO, Tarabella\u2019s lawyer Maxim T\u00f6ller said the MEP would support the lifting of his immunity. \u201cSince the beginning of this investigation, Marc Tarabella has repeated that he is at the disposal of the judiciary and has even asked to be questioned rapidly in order to defend himself. He has equally said that he would not hide behind his parliamentary immunity,\u201d T\u00f6ller wrote.\n\nMetsola was present during a search that Belgian police conducted at Tarabella\u2019s house on December 10, looking for potentially compromising material.\n\nTarabella has proclaimed his innocence. He is vice chair of the European Parliament\u2019s delegation for relations with the Arab Peninsula and co-chair of the institution\u2019s sports group \u2014 an important role in the leadup to Qatar\u2019s hosting of the FIFA World Cup last year.\n\nCozzolino publicly asked for his immunity to be lifted and has also denied wrongdoing.\n\nItalian MEP Andrea Cozzolino belongs to the S&D group | European Parliament\n\nSince the scandal broke, Cozzolino temporarily stood down as chair of a delegation for relations with Maghreb countries and also stood back from his role as his group\u2019s coordinator on drafting resolutions on human rights abuses outside the EU. At the time of publishing, he had not responded to POLITICO\u2019s requests for comment.\n\n\u201cPresident Metsola will also set out her intentions for reforms in the coming weeks, including an overhaul of the current rules and improving internal systems, including on enforcement,\u201d the Parliament said in a press statement. Metsola wants the immunity waiver to be wrapped up by mid-February.\n\nPieter Haeck contributed reporting.",

        "text": "China\u2019s warplane incursions into Taiwan\u2019s air defence zone nearly doubled in 2022, with a surge in fighter jet and bomber sorties as Beijing intensified threats towards the island democracy.\n\nSelf-ruled Taiwan lives under constant threat of invasion. Communist party rulers claim the island as part of China\u2019s territory and have vowed to seize it one day.\n\nRelations have been icy for years under President Xi Jinping, China\u2019s most assertive leader in a generation.\n\n2022 saw a deeper deterioration, as Xi\u2019s military ramped up incursions and launched the largest war games in decades to protest against a visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in August.\n\nChina sent 1,727 planes into Taiwan\u2019s air defence identification zone (ADIZ) in 2022, according to an AFP database based on daily updates released by Taipei\u2019s defence ministry.\n\nThat compares with about 960 incursions in 2021 and 380 in 2020.\n\nFighter jet sorties more than doubled from 538 in 2021 to 1,241 while incursions by bombers, including the nuclear-capable H6, went from 60 to 101.\n\nLast year also saw the first incursions by drones, with all 71 reported by Taiwan\u2019s military coming after Pelosi\u2019s visit.\n\nMilitary analysts say China has used the incursions to probe Taiwan\u2019s defences, exhaust its ageing air force and voice displeasure over western support for Taipei, especially the United States.\n\n\u201cThey want to show their determination, their will and to coerce the United States: don\u2019t get too close to their red lines, don\u2019t cross their red lines,\u201d Lee Hsi-min, Taiwan\u2019s former chief of general staff, told AFP.\n\nChina sent 71 warplanes to conduct a \u201cstrike exercise\u201d on 25 December in response to what it described as \u201cescalating collusion and provocations\u201d by Washington and Taipei.\n\nThat came days after US president Joe Biden signed off on up to $10bn in military aid to Taiwan.\n\nAugust saw a record 440 sorties by Chinese warplanes, the same month Pelosi became the highest-ranking US lawmaker to visit Taiwan in 25 years.\n\n\u201cThe more frequent sorties are worrying and compel the Taiwanese side to be in a perpetual state of alert to ensure that the PLA (People\u2019s Liberation Army) does not use them as cover for an attack against Taiwan,\u201d Taipei-based political and military analyst J Michael Cole told AFP.\n\nHowever, he also said a rise in incursions \u201cdoes not signify that (China) is ready to use force at an earlier date against Taiwan \u2013 at least not an invasion scenario, which would require months of mobilisation\u201d.\n\nMany nations maintain air defence identification zones, including the United States, Canada, South Korea, Japan and China, which are not the same as a country\u2019s airspace.\n\nThey instead encompass a much wider area in which any foreign aircraft is expected to announce itself to local aviation authorities.\n\nAnalysts say China\u2019s increased probing of Taiwan\u2019s defence zone is part of wider \u201cgrey-zone\u201d tactics that keep the island pressured.\n\n\u201cThe PRC (People\u2019s Republic of China) is launching a war of attrition on the Taiwanese military,\u201d said Richard Hu, deputy director of National Chengchi University\u2019s Taiwan Centre for Security Studies.\n\nWhile China intends to collect crucial intelligence and \u201creadiness parameters\u201d, such as how quickly and from where Taiwan\u2019s interceptions take place, an invasion remains a hugely risky and costly endeavour.\n\nThe mountainous island would be a formidable challenge for any military to conquer.\n\n\u201cIn terms of taking Taiwan by force, PRC is still confronting a number of vital challenges such as sending hundreds of thousands of troops across the Taiwan Strait,\u201d said Hu, a retired army major general.",

I welcome the launch today of the Group of Friends to Promote Accountability for Crimes Against Peacekeepers, which will enable collective progress by the @UN & Member States. #A4P https://t.co/Bpoalh7cTI Jean-Pierre Lacroix Lacroix_UN\n\nHowever, serious challenges in bringing criminals to justice have led to a low prosecution rate, and contributed to a cycle of impunity that continues to embolden offenders.\n\nNoting that the Group of Friends will be significant in promoting accountability and facilitating capacity-building and technical assistance to host State authorities, Mr. Lacroix offered the UN\u2019s full support, including by monitoring progress and serving as a Secretariat.\n\n\u2018Notable progress\u2019\n\nAlthough few perpetrators have been brought to justice, he highlighted some \u201cnotable progress\u201d since 2019.\n\nIn the Central African Republic (CAR), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Mali \u2013 the three countries where 84 per cent of fatalities have occurred across peacekeeping operations since the beginning of 2013 \u2013 there has been \u201can increase in the number of alleged perpetrators identified and detained and an increase in the percentage of cases with confirmed national investigations\u201d, Mr. Lacroix said.\n\n\u201cMost importantly, 66 individuals have been convicted\u201d in CAR, DRC, Lebanon, and Mali for killing UN troops, he added.\n\nUnacceptable track record\n\nReferring to the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali by its French acronym, the peacekeeping chief pointed to the 10 October deaths of four MINUSMA colleagues from Chad \u201cdue to the explosion of an IED in Tessalit\u201d, which served to underscore \u201cthe continued importance of this issue\u201d.\n\nAnd malicious acts since 26 July, have taken the lives of Indian, Moroccan and Pakistani peacekeepers serving in the UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) and three Bangladeshi blue helmets in the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the CAR (MINUSCA).\n\n\u201cTwenty-nine peacekeepers have died in such circumstances since the beginning of this year\u201d, the UN peacekeeping chief said, extending \u201cdeepest condolences to the Governments and families of those who have fallen\u201d.\n\nOnly a few hours before Thursday\u2019s meeting, another peacekeeper, from the UN mission in southern Lebanon, UNIFIL, was killed, after coming under attack.\n\nUN Photo/Catianne Tijerina UN peacekeepers patrol Bambari in the Central African Republic.\n\nBring culprits to justice\n\n\u201cIt is critical for countries hosting operations to bring perpetrators of these crimes to justice, in accordance with their international obligations\u201d, he stressed.\n\nMr. Lacroix recalled the Security Council\u2019s 2020 resolution (2518) on the safety of peacekeepers, which calls \u201con all Member States hosting peacekeeping operations to promptly investigate and effectively prosecute those responsible for attacks on United Nations personnel\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, in 2021 the Council adopted resolution 2589 on strengthening accountability for crimes committed against peacekeepers, calling for a renewed focus on bringing perpetrators against UN personnel to justice.\n\nWhile the primary responsibility for bringing criminals to account lies with host States, he highlighted that the UN would continue to pursue accountability, particularly in CAR, DRC and Mali.\n\nSupporting host countries\n\nAlthough a working group has been supporting host countries in investigating and prosecuting these offences since 2019, important challenges remain.\n\n\u201cThese crimes are often committed in areas where the authority of the State may be limited and national law enforcement personnel may be absent\u201d, often creating roadblocks for witness security and evidence collection and preservation, the senior UN official said.\n\nMoreover, personnel rotation and repatriation are obstacles to witness testimonies.\n\n\u201cThese challenges are further compounded in some instances by the absence of political will to pursue these cases\u201d, he flagged.\n\nUN/Byobe Malenga\n\nMoving forward\n\nMr. Lacrox recalled that bringing perpetrators to justice, in accordance with their international obligations, is outlined in \u201cstatus-of-force or status-of-mission agreements, in addition to other instruments\u201d.\n\nMaintaining that international support is \u201cindispensable to achieving success\u201d, he noted that it could take the form of political pressure, or through the provision of technical and material assistance, based on national plans and priorities.\n\nWhile field missions play important support roles within their mandated responsibilities, he upheld that support from Member States was \u201cessential\u201d, such as by deploying specialized personnel to assist national authorities in investigating and prosecuting these cases.\n\nStating that advocacy was \u201cvital\u201d, Mr. Lacroix strongly welcomed the official launch of the Group of Friends.",

Because the three big economies \u2013 the US, EU and China \u2013 are all slowing down simultaneously,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe expect one-third of the world economy to be in recession. Even countries that are not in recession, it would feel like recession for hundreds of millions of people,\u201d she added.\n\n2023 IMF PREDICTION: \u201cWe expect one-third of the world economy to be in recession,\u201d IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva tells @margbrennan. But, a strong U.S. labor market might help the world get through a difficult year, she says. pic.twitter.com/Vbhj478pFo \u2014 Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) January 1, 2023\n\nIn October, the IMF cut its outlook for global economic growth in 2023, reflecting the continuing drag from the war in Ukraine as well as inflation pressures and the high interest rates engineered by central banks like the US Federal Reserve aimed at bringing those price pressures to heel.\n\nGeorgieva said that China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, is likely to grow at or below global growth for the first time in 40 years as Covid-19 cases surge following the dismantling of its ultra-strict zero-Covid policy.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in 40 years, China\u2019s growth in 2022 is likely to be at or below global growth,\u201d Georgieva said.\n\n2023 will be a difficult year for the world. The silver lining is we can use it to transform economies & accelerate change that\u2019s good for our climate, good for growth. At the IMF, we recognize our responsibility to be a force for good.

We see the labour market remaining quite strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is \u2026 a mixed blessing because if the labour market is very strong, the Fed may have to keep interest rates tighter for longer to bring inflation down,\u201d Georgieva said.\n\nThe US job market will be a central focus for Federal Reserve officials who would like to see demand for labour slacken to help undercut price pressures. The first week of the new year brings a raft of key data on the employment front, including Friday\u2019s monthly nonfarm payrolls report, which is expected to show the US economy minted another 200,000 jobs in December and the jobless rate remained at 3.7% \u2013 near the lowest since the 1960s.\n\nReuters contributed to this report",

According to the secretary general, \u201cthat's the only way to convince Russia that they have to sit down and negotiate in good faith and respect Ukraine as a sovereign independent nation in Europe.\u201d\n\n\"What we do know is that what Ukraine can achieve around that table is totally dependent on the strength on the battlefield,\" he stressed.\n\nOn Friday, Stoltenberg claimed that while \u201cit may sound paradoxical,\u201d Western military support for Ukraine is \"the quickest way to peace.\u201d\n\nFollowing the start of Russia\u2019s military operation in late February, Western countries have ramped up their weapons shipments to Ukraine, a move that has been condemned by Moscow. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that NATO was using the military potential of nearly all of its member states against Moscow in Ukraine. According to the president, efforts to undermine the Russian economy in the \u201csanctions war\u201d over Ukraine have largely failed.\n\nEarlier, he also accused the West of turning Ukraine into \u201ca colony\u201d, and using its people as \u201ccannon fodder, a battering ram against Russia.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the Kremlin maintains it is open to talks with Ukraine, accusing Kiev of refusing to negotiate. However, Moscow has insisted that Kiev must \u201crecognize the reality on the ground\u201d as a prerequisite for any peace talks, including the new status of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson and Zaporozhye as parts of Russia.",

Trials were not conducted fairly: https://t.co/NdbsZ4Aqbm https://t.co/XzMkChw19g UN Human Rights UNHumanRights\n\nOn Wednesday, a military court sentenced at least seven university students to death.\n\n\u201cMilitary courts have consistently failed to uphold any degree of transparency contrary to the most basic due process or fair trial guarantees\u201d, underscored Mr. T\u00fcrk.\n\nMeanwhile, on Thursday, reports revealed that as many as four additional death sentences were being issued against youth activists.\n\nThe UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) is currently seeking clarification on those cases.\n\nNo justice\n\nIn July, the military carried out four State executions \u2013 the first in approximately 30 years.\n\nDespite calls from the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the international community to desist, a former lawmaker, a democracy activist, and two others, were put to death.\n\nClose to 1,700 detainees out of the nearly 16,500 who have been arrested for opposing last year\u2019s military\u2019s coup have been tried and convicted in secret by ad hoc tribunals, sometimes lasting just minutes.\n\nThey have frequently been denied access to lawyers or their families and none have been acquitted.\n\nThe latest convictions would bring the total number of people sentenced to capital punishment since 1 February 2021 to 139 individuals.\n\nUnaligned with ASEAN\n\nMr. T\u00fcrk reminded that the military\u2019s actions are not in keeping with the ASEAN peace plan, known as the five-point consensus \u2013 that includes the \u201cimmediate cessation of violence in Myanmar\u201d \u2013 which the regional bloc had re-committed to upholding last month during the ASEAN summit.\n\nAt the summit, Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres had warned that the political, security, human rights and humanitarian situation in Myanmar was \u201csliding ever deeper into catastrophe\u201d, condemning the escalating violence, disproportionate use of force, and \u201cappalling human rights situation\u201d in the country.\n\nMilitary courts have consistently failed to uphold any degree of transparency \u2013 UN rights chief\n\n\u201cBy resorting to use death sentences as a political tool to crush opposition, the military confirms its disdain for the efforts by ASEAN and the international community at large to end violence and create the conditions for a political dialogue to lead Myanmar out of a human rights crisis created by the military\u201d the UN human rights chief spelled out.\n\nForced evictions\n\nAt the same time, the Myanmar military is forcibly evicting over 50,000 people from informal settlements and systematically destroying homes in what two UN-appointed independent human rights experts called a fundamental violation of core human rights obligations.\n\nWithout providing alternative housing or land, last month more than 40,000 residents living in informal settlements throughout Mingaladon, a township in northern Yangon, were evicted \u2013 with most given only a few days to dismantle the homes that they had lived in for decades.\n\nAfter receiving eviction notices, the lack of options swayed some residents to remain while two reportedly committed suicide out of desperation.\n\n\u201cForced evictions from Mingaladon are only part of the story. Violent arbitrary housing demolitions continue across the country\u201d, the Special Rapporteurs on the right to adequate housing, Balakrishnan Rajagopal, and situation of human rights in Myanmar, Thomas Andrews, said in a statement.\n\nUNHCR/Roger Arnold Rohingya Muslims forced from Myanmar flee to Bangladesh.\n\n'Scorched earth' policy\n\nAccording to the experts, not only those living in informal settlements in Myanmar\u2019s cities were subjected to forced evictions and housing demolitions.\n\n\u201cHomes continued to be systematically destroyed, bombed and burned down in orchestrated attacks on villages by the Myanmar security forces and junta-backed militias\u201d, they said.\n\nSince the military coup last year, more than 38,000 houses have been destroyed, triggering the widespread displacement of over 1.1 million people.\n\nOn 23 November, 95 of 130 houses in the Kyunhla Township were burned down when the Myanmar military set fire to the settlement.\n\nThese incidents follow patterns of violence used against Rohingya villages during genocidal attacks in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe policies of scorched earth in Myanmar are widespread and follow a systematic pattern,\u201d the experts said.\n\nSpecial Rapporteurs are appointed by the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Council to examine and report back on a specific human rights theme or a country situation. The positions are honorary and the experts are not paid for their work.",

And it is not beyond the realm of possibility that they say, \u2018Keep out, we\u2019re here, this is our territory.\u2019\u201d\n\nNelson cited Chinese aggression over islands in the South China Sea, where Beijing has established military bases, as evidence of its territorial ambition. \u201cIf you doubt that, look at what they did with the Spratly Islands,\u201d he said.\n\nLast year, China\u2019s space program put up an Earth-orbiting space station and has mounted several lunar orbiting and sample-retrieving missions. A third phase of the program, to establish an autonomous lunar research station near the Moon\u2019s south pole, is scheduled for 2025.\n\nIn December, the Chinese government offered its vision for a crewed lunar landing, space transportation, infrastructure and space governance. China has also announced the goal of landing taikonauts on the moon by the end of this decade.\n\nStudents listen to an introduction to the Chang'e 5 moon sample-return spacecraft, at the InnoTech Expo in Hong Kong, China, last month. Photograph: Tyrone Siu/Reuters\n\nNasa, meanwhile, recently completed the 26-day Artemis I mission to take pictures of the lunar surface. Future missions are designed toward establishing more activity on the moon. However, the US is also focused on Mars.\n\nUS military brass have also sounded alarm over Chinese militarization of space and attendant security concerns.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible they could catch up and surpass us,\u201d Space Force Lt Gen Nina Armagno said on a visit to Australia. \u201cThe progress they\u2019ve made has been stunning \u2013 stunningly fast.\u201d\n\nBut Beijing has rejected some US interpretations of the motives behind China\u2019s space push. \u201cOuter space is not a wrestling ground,\u201d Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, told Politico.\n\nThe spokesman said that some US officials had \u201cspoken irresponsibly to misrepresent the normal and legitimate space endeavors of China\u201d.\n\n\u201cChina always advocates the peaceful use of outer space, opposes the weaponization of and arms race in outer space, and works actively toward building a community with a shared future for mankind in the space domain,\u201d the statement added.",

The bombardment hit a temporary housing area used by the Russian forces in Donbass.\n\nThe facility in the city of Makeyevka in Russia\u2019s Donetsk People\u2019s Republic was targeted by six missiles from US-supplied HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, the Defense ministry said. Two projectiles were intercepted by air defenses, but four made it through, the statement added.\n\n\"As a result of a strike by four missiles with high-explosive warheads on a temporary deployment point, 63 Russian servicemen were killed,\u201d Defense Ministry spokesman Lieutenant General Igor Konashenkov said during a briefing.\n\nAll necessary assistance and support will be provided to the families of the fallen troops, the ministry assured.\n\nThe strike was earlier reported by the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic\u2019s Information Minister Daniil Bezsonov, who said the missiles targeted the building of a vocational school where the troops were stationed. It happened precisely at 0:01 am on New Year\u2019s night, while the serviceman were celebrating, he added.\n\nRussia\u2019s Foreign Ministry earlier condemned Washington for not only supplying sophisticated weapons to Kiev, but also providing the Ukrainian military with intelligence about the location of the Russian forces.",

Two Tu-160M aircraft have also been submitted for flight tests. One of them is an upgraded version of an existing plane, while the other had been built from scratch, as part of Russia\u2019s recent efforts to restart its strategic plane-manufacturing program.\n\nLast month, Ukraine made at least two attempts to strike airfields that host long-range aviation crews, deep inside Russian territory, in Saratov and Ryazan regions. According to the Defense Ministry, the modified \u201cSoviet-made\u201d jet drones, which targeted the Engels and Dyagilevo bases, were shot down by air defenses. However, debris from the destroyed UAVs ended up killing six servicemen on the ground and on one occasion inflicted minor damage to two aircraft.",

They are independent of any government or organization, operate in their individual capacity, and are neither UN staff nor are they paid for their work.",
